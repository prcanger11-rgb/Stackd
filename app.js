    overview:'You deconstruct the universe into precise, internal logical frameworks (Ti-Ne). You look at the INTJ and see a fellow architect of abstract systems—someone who shares your deep distrust of social consensus, but who completely bypasses the joy of open-ended variables to brutally force a singular, closed conclusion (Ni-Te).',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate structural anchor. They provide the decisive commitment and real-world execution that actually gives your endless theoretical frameworks somewhere to land. In return, your expansive exploration (Ne) rigorously challenges their rigid models and prevents them from calcifying prematurely.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute need to lock down a decision and forcefully close doors to be intellectually suspicious and deeply premature. To their Te, your endless need to keep analyzing variables without ever committing looks like pure, avoidant paralysis.',
    dynamic:'The detached analyst and the strategic mastermind. It is a pairing of profound, mutual intellectual respect, but it constantly wrestles with a core structural friction: you want to keep the variables open, and they want to close the case.',
    working:'You must respect the sequence of operations. You own the rigorous challenge phase early on, but once they drop the hammer and make the final decision (Te), you must accept that the analysis is over and execution has begun.',
    friction:'They will make a hard, binding decision to move a project forward. You will casually attempt to reopen the framework to introduce a new, fascinating variable. They will view your openness as infuriating avoidance, and you will view their closure as intellectually lazy.'

    overview:'You synthesize complex variables to project and execute optimal, long-term future outcomes (Ni-Te). You look at the INTP and see a fellow abstract thinker—someone who shares your exact distrust of social consensus, but who constantly shatters your singular vision into a million branching, open-ended logical frameworks (Ti-Ne).',
    strengths:'They are your ultimate intellectual stress-test. Before you invest massive resources into a flawed strategy, they rigorously dismantle your model and find the hidden vulnerabilities you completely missed. It is a genuinely brilliant, highly robust intellectual partnership.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute refusal to fully commit to a direction and their tendency to analyze a problem indefinitely to be highly inefficient and deeply frustrating. You both have entirely different relationships with certainty: you crave it, they avoid it.',
    dynamic:'The strategic mastermind and the detached analyst. There is immense mutual respect for each other\'s depth, but massive friction regarding output. You want a final decision; they want more variables.',
    working:'You must let them rigorously challenge your model *before* you commit to an execution plan. The friction they provide is highly useful. However, you must be the one to finally draw the line, set the deadline, and decide what survives.',
    friction:'You will demand a final answer to begin execution. They will refuse to provide one, insisting the logical framework needs more stress-testing. You will view their open-endedness as weak indecision, and they will view your demand for certainty as premature closure.'

    'ENFJ-ENTJ':{
    overview:'You guide people toward a unified, meaningful future by carefully managing the emotional environment and building consensus (Fe-Ni). You look at the ENTJ and see a fellow commander—someone who shares your exact drive to organize and lead the group (Ni), but who enforces cold, ruthless accountability and objective metrics (Te) completely devoid of human empathy.',
    strengths:'You are an unstoppable leadership duo if you perfectly divide your territory. They provide the absolute, unflinching directive clarity and hard logistical boundaries that you naturally hesitate to enforce. In return, you brilliantly handle the complex, messy relational layer that they completely lack the patience to manage.',
    shadow:'Because you are both dominant extroverted judgers (Fe vs. Te), you both inherently believe you should be leading the room. You will view their blunt, unilateral directives as toxic and culturally damaging, while they will view your constant need to manage everyone\'s feelings and build consensus as a massive, inefficient roadblock.',
    dynamic:'The cultural orchestrator and the commanding general. It is highly complementary if you respect each other\'s distinct domains, but fiercely combative if you try to share the exact same steering wheel.',
    working:'You absolutely must divide your leadership roles. You own the people layer, the culture, and the emotional motivation. They own the strategic direction, the hard metrics, and the final cut. Do not try to compete for the same type of authority.',
    friction:'They will unilaterally enforce a harsh new policy to meet a metric, completely ignoring the emotional toll it takes on the group. You will fiercely intervene to protect the people. They will view you as weak and insubordinate, and you will view them as a destructive tyrant.'

  'ENFJ-INTP':{
    overview:'You navigate reality by orchestrating the emotional environment and taking on the emotional weight of everyone around you (Fe-Ni). You look at the INTP and see a detached brain floating in a jar—someone who deconstructs the universe using pure, cold logic (Ti-Ne) but who seems entirely disconnected from the human experience.',
    strengths:'They provide the profound, rigorous logical stress-testing that your emotionally driven mind frequently needs. Before you overcommit to a flawed vision just because it "feels right," they can systematically dissect it. In return, you provide the warm, human context and social grace that they naturally lack.',
    shadow:'You will find their complete emotional detachment and blunt communication style to be deeply isolating and relationally cold. Because your primary operating system is built on human connection (Fe), their tendency to view social rituals as "illogical noise" will frequently feel like a rejection of your care.',
    dynamic:'The cultural orchestrator and the detached analyst. It is an incredibly powerful pairing of pure warmth and pure logic, but it requires massive translation because you process the world using completely opposing sets of data.',
    working:'You must recognize that their introverted thinking (Ti) does not speak the language of emotional validation. Do not force them to perform extroverted warmth. Let them handle the cold analytical layer, and you handle the complex people reading. Both forms of intelligence are real and necessary.',
    friction:'You will try to engage them in a deep, emotionally validating conversation to build connection. They will respond by bluntly analyzing the logical inconsistencies in your feelings. You will feel profoundly unseen and hurt, while they will remain completely baffled by your emotional reaction.'

  'INTP-ENFJ':{
    overview:'You deconstruct the universe into precise, internal logical frameworks (Ti-Ne). You look at the ENFJ and see someone whose entire existence revolves around actively managing group consensus, enforcing social norms, and performing an exhausting, irrational social harmony (Fe-Ni) at the expense of objective truth.',
    strengths:'They are your ultimate social and emotional translator. While you are lost in a purely theoretical realm, they effortlessly handle the complex relational dynamics, social networking, and emotional heavy lifting that you naturally find exhausting, keeping you connected to actual humanity.',
    shadow:'You will find their constant need to manage the emotional temperature of the room and validate everyone\'s feelings to be distracting, inefficient, and highly performative. Their tendency to prioritize "keeping the peace" over acknowledging the harsh, logical truth will frequently strike your Ti as fundamentally fake.',
    dynamic:'The detached analyst and the cultural orchestrator. They provide the warm relational structure, and you provide the rigorous logic. However, you fundamentally clash over the value of objective truth versus the value of social comfort.',
    working:'You absolutely must respect that their extroverted feeling (Fe) is a highly complex, valid form of real-world data, not just irrational sentiment. Stop treating their social diplomacy as a logical flaw. In return, they must give you the quiet, unpressured space you need to process information.',
    friction:'They will carefully navigate a delicate social situation to protect someone\'s feelings. You will bluntly point out the objective, logical truth of the matter, instantly destroying the illusion. They will be horrified by your lack of empathy, and you will mock their need for performance.'

  'ENTJ-ENFJ':{
    overview:'You structure reality to achieve massive, long-term outcomes through strict accountability and objective metrics (Te-Ni). You look at the ENFJ and see a fellow commander—someone who shares your exact drive to organize the future (Ni), but who is completely bogged down by the exhausting need to manage everyone\'s feelings and build group consensus (Fe).',
    strengths:'They flawlessly handle the messy, complex human element that you naturally bypass. While you are driving the overarching strategy and enforcing the bottom line, they manage the cultural climate, ensuring the people actually stay motivated enough to execute your plans.',
    shadow:'Because you are both extroverted judgers, you both inherently want to lead the group. You will frequently view their need for emotional validation and "process-oriented" consensus as a massive, inefficient roadblock. To your Te, a decision should be executed immediately, not voted on by the feelings of the team.',
    dynamic:'The commanding general and the cultural orchestrator. It is a highly productive pairing if roles are perfectly defined, but it turns into a brutal, scorched-earth turf war if you both try to lead the exact same project.',
    working:'Total separation of leadership domains is the only way this works. You own the strategic direction, the budget, and the final operational cut. They own the people, the morale, and the communication. Do not try to micromanage their relational diplomacy.',
    friction:'You will demand a task be completed immediately, completely ignoring the emotional burnout of the group. They will actively intervene and block your directive to protect the team\'s culture. You will view them as a soft, insubordinate liability, and they will view you as a destructive tyrant.'
  },
  'INTP-INTP':{
    overview:'You are looking in a mirror at another dominant Ti and auxiliary Ne user. You both navigate the universe by building incredibly precise, elaborate internal logical frameworks, constantly questioning consensus, and keeping every possible conceptual variable open indefinitely.',
    strengths:'An unparalleled, almost terrifying intellectual range. You share a brilliant ability to rigorously stress-test ideas together without taking anything personally. You never have to explain your need for analytical depth or your hatred of superficial answers.',
    shadow:'Because neither of you possesses the natural instinct to actually make a decision or close a door, you will both endlessly analyze the universe without ever participating in it. The frameworks will expand indefinitely because actually finishing something makes it tangible and subject to judgment.',
    dynamic:'The ultimate theoretical echo chamber. It is an incredibly stimulating, purely intellectual playground, but one that is completely, fundamentally unproductive without massive external pressure.',
    working:'You absolutely must introduce harsh external constraints into your shared life. You must explicitly set an artificial endpoint for the analysis phase and assign someone the painful responsibility of simply calling a project "done."',
    friction:'A critical practical problem will emerge that requires immediate action. Because neither of you wants to be the first to commit to a flawed solution, the disagreement will turn into a permanent, open theoretical debate, and the problem will never actually be solved.'

    'ESFJ-ENTJ':{
    overview:'You manage reality by orchestrating social harmony and upholding reliable traditions (Fe-Si). You look at the ENTJ and see a ruthless executive—someone obsessed with controlling the future and enforcing rigid metrics (Te-Ni) with absolutely zero regard for how their decisions impact human feelings.',
    strengths:'You are an unstoppable force when operating in parallel. They possess the sheer strategic willpower and organizational structure to build an empire, while you possess the social intelligence and warmth to actually build the thriving, cohesive culture that sustains it.',
    shadow:'You will find their blunt, directive communication style (Te) to be unnecessarily aggressive, hostile, and relationally damaging. To your Fe, their willingness to bulldoze the group\'s morale just to hit a deadline is both toxic and short-sighted.',
    dynamic:'The cultural pillar and the commanding general. It is a highly productive pairing if you stay in your lanes, but there is constant friction when their operational demands crash into your relational domain.',
    working:'Let them own the strategic direction and the heavy structural decisions. However, you must draw a hard line to protect the culture. Do not take their bluntness personally—translate their Te directives into Fe language so the team can actually digest them.',
    friction:'They will issue a harsh, unilateral directive to increase efficiency. You will fiercely defend the people, warning them that they are destroying the team\'s morale. They will view your defense as soft and inefficient, and you will view them as a destructive tyrant.'

  'ENTJ-ESFJ':{
    overview:'You structure reality to achieve massive, long-term outcomes (Te-Ni). You look at the ESFJ and see someone whose entire operating system is bogged down by an exhausting need to manage everyone\'s feelings (Fe) and uphold arbitrary, outdated traditions (Si).',
    strengths:'They flawlessly handle the messy human element that you naturally bypass. While you are driving the overarching strategy and enforcing the bottom line, they are reading the room, managing the relational politics, and keeping your team from quitting under your intense pressure.',
    shadow:'You will view their constant need for consensus and emotional validation as soft, inefficient, and highly unprofessional. When a hard choice needs to be made, their desire to keep everyone happy will look like a massive operational liability to your Te.',
    dynamic:'The master strategist and the cultural caretaker. You are a highly effective team if you respect the division of labor. You build the machine; they keep the humans operating it from burning out.',
    working:'You absolutely must recognize that managing morale is not a distraction from the work—it *is* the work. If you want to maintain a functional environment, you have to let them handle the relational layer their way. Stop bulldozing their Fe with your Te.',
    friction:'You will demand a task be completed on a strict timeline, regardless of whose feelings are hurt. They will actively subvert or delay the order to protect the group\'s culture. You will view them as insubordinate, and they will view you as a heartless sociopath.'
  },
  'ESFJ-INTP':{
    overview:'You curate reality by maintaining group harmony, upholding traditions, and ensuring everyone feels cared for (Fe-Si). You look at the INTP and see a detached brain in a jar—someone who builds massive abstract systems (Ti-Ne) but seems entirely disconnected from basic social grace and human emotion.',
    strengths:'They offer a profound, completely non-judgmental intellectual depth that is a rare break from your hyper-social world. Because they do not demand emotional performance, you can actually relax around them, while you provide the warm social grounding they completely lack.',
    shadow:'You will frequently view their absolute refusal to participate in social rituals or conform to "appropriate" behavior as incredibly selfish and immature. Their tendency to bluntly point out the logical flaws in your traditions will feel like a deliberate, hostile attack on your values.',
    dynamic:'The social orchestrator and the detached analyst. You share absolutely no cognitive functions in the same order, making this a fascinating collision. You live to connect; they live to deconstruct.',
    working:'You must accept that they do not speak the language of emotional validation. Stop trying to force them to perform extroverted warmth, and do not view their need for profound isolation as a personal insult. They are simply operating on a different frequency.',
    friction:'You will try to gently enforce a social norm to keep the peace. They will bluntly and publicly point out why the norm makes absolutely no logical sense (Ti). You will feel humiliated and angry at their disruption, while they will be confused as to why the truth upset you.'
  },
  'INTP-ESFJ':{
    overview:'You deconstruct the universe into precise, logical frameworks (Ti-Ne). You look at the ESFJ and see the ultimate conformist—someone whose entire existence revolves around upholding arbitrary social rules (Si) and performing a fake, consensus-seeking warmth (Fe) at the expense of objective truth.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate logistical and social shield. While you are lost in a purely theoretical void, they effortlessly maintain the physical, administrative, and relational reality that keeps you tethered to the actual world and prevents you from completely isolating yourself.',
    shadow:'You will find their constant need to manage group harmony, enforce traditions, and silence "inappropriate" ideas to be a suffocating intellectual prison. Their tendency to take your objective logical analysis as a personal emotional attack will make communication incredibly tedious.',
    dynamic:'The mad scientist and the concerned parent. They provide the warm, structured reality, and you provide the detached analysis. You are completely opposite in every way, meaning you will frequently talk straight past each other.',
    working:'You must recognize that their social intelligence (Fe) is a highly complex, genuine skill, not just "fakeness." Do not treat their deeply held traditions as logical punching bags. Turn off your Ti debate mode in social settings they are actively managing.',
    friction:'You will state a blunt, objective fact that shatters a comforting social illusion. They will become intensely defensive and accuse you of being cruel and inappropriate. You will feel suffocated by their irrationality, and they will feel attacked by your complete lack of empathy.'

  'INTJ-INTJ':{
    overview:'You are looking in a mirror at another dominant Ni and auxiliary Te user. You both navigate reality by synthesizing deep, complex future patterns, ruthlessly executing toward a singular vision, and maintaining an absolute, unyielding certainty in your own foresight.',
    strengths:'An incredibly rare, highly formidable alliance of pure discipline. You both possess the extraordinary ability to hold a massive, long-range vision without requiring any external validation. When perfectly aligned, you are an unstoppable, highly efficient machine.',
    shadow:'Because you both rely entirely on internal intuition (Ni) with absolutely no external fact-checking, two INTJs can effortlessly build a massive, elaborate shared model of reality that is confidently, dangerously wrong. Furthermore, introverted feeling (Fi) is the absolute last thing either of you will ever acknowledge.',
    dynamic:'The ultimate mastermind syndicate. It is highly efficient and terrifyingly powerful when perfectly aligned, but quietly, brutally cold when it fractures. Absolutely no one manages conflict worse than two INTJs who have decided to ignore an emotional problem.',
    working:'You absolutely must explicitly align on the overarching goal upfront, out loud. Two Ni dominants will frequently form internal visions that feel identical on the surface but silently diverge in critical, structural details. You must proactively communicate to avoid parallel, conflicting realities.',
    friction:'A structural disagreement will arise. Because neither of you will ever yield once your Ni has locked onto a conclusion, the disagreement will bypass healthy debate entirely and immediately calcify into a permanent, freezing cold distance.'
  },
'ENTJ-INTJ':{
    overview:'You structure reality to achieve massive, long-term outcomes and execute them with ruthless efficiency (Te-Ni). You look at the INTJ and see a fellow visionary (Ni-Te)—someone who shares your exact cognitive stack but operates in reverse, internalizing the strategy deeply before ever making a move.',
    strengths:'An incredibly formidable, highly capable alliance. You provide the explosive momentum and execution bandwidth to actually get things moving, while they provide the profound, internalized strategic depth that keeps your empire pointed in the exact right direction.',
    shadow:'Because you are both relentless extroverted thinkers (Te), you will inevitably engage in a massive power struggle for control. They will frequently find your aggressive pace to be intellectually shallow, while you will find their slow, internalized processing to be an agonizing operational bottleneck.',
    dynamic:'The commanding general and the strategic architect. High mutual respect, but highly vulnerable to an immovable clash of wills since neither of you naturally yields authority.',
    working:'You absolutely must divide your domains explicitly. You manage the rapid execution, the external structure, and the people. Let them own the deep, internalized strategic layer. Clear boundaries prevent the collision.',
    friction:'You will aggressively push the pace to hit a milestone, skipping over deep analysis. They will completely withdraw into silence to process the structural flaw in your plan. You will view their silence as stubborn resistance, and they will view your speed as reckless arrogance.'
  },
  'ENTJ-INTP':{
    overview:'You structure reality to achieve massive, long-term outcomes and optimize entirely for ruthless execution (Te-Ni). You look at the INTP and see a detached analyst—someone who deconstructs the universe using pure, cold logic (Ti-Ne) but who seems entirely unconcerned with actually building anything in the real world.',
    strengths:'A massively productive tension if respected. They provide the profound, rigorous analytical depth that prevents your rapid execution from optimizing toward the wrong thing. In return, you provide the absolute structural willpower and deadlines that their brilliant theories desperately need to survive.',
    shadow:'You will frequently view their endless need to keep questions open and their refusal to commit to a conclusion as lazy, inefficient, and maddeningly slow. To their Ti, your demand for premature answers and immediate action looks like intellectual shallowness.',
    dynamic:'The commanding general and the detached analyst. High value when the sequence is respected, but intense friction over whether the primary goal is to build (Te) or to understand (Ti).',
    working:'You must set the clear goal and the absolute deadline, but you must give them the uninterrupted space to do the deep analytical work within that constraint. Do not rush their process, but demand they actually produce an output when the deadline arrives.',
    friction:'You will demand an immediate, actionable answer to solve a problem. They will refuse to give one because their logical framework is not yet perfect. You will absolutely explode at their lack of urgency, and they will completely dismiss your certainty as intellectual laziness.'
  },
  'INTP-ENTJ':{
    overview:'You deconstruct the universe into precise, internal logical frameworks (Ti-Ne). You look at the ENTJ and see a relentless executive—someone who optimizes entirely for massive, real-world execution (Te-Ni) but who completely bypasses the rigorous analytical depth required to actually understand what they are building.',
    strengths:'An incredibly powerful pairing of depth and momentum. You provide the rigorous logical stress-testing that makes their execution significantly smarter. In return, they provide the ironclad external structure, funding, and willpower that actually gives your brilliant theories a life outside your head.',
    shadow:'You will find their aggressive speed, blunt communication, and absolute demand for immediate output to be highly suffocating and intellectually premature. To their Te, your constant need for more time to perfect the framework looks like lazy, paralyzing uncertainty.',
    dynamic:'The detached analyst and the commanding general. It is highly productive when they respect your process, but deeply combative when they treat your rigorous analysis as mere obstructionism.',
    working:'They must own the deadline and the overarching goal. You must do the deep analytical work within that specific constraint. You must understand that their read on a situation is based on objective execution metrics (Te), not intellectual laziness.',
    friction:'They will forcefully commit to a direction that you know is logically flawed simply because it is "good enough" to execute. You will try to halt the operation to fix the underlying framework. They will view you as a useless obstructionist, and you will view them as dangerously reckless.'
  },
    'ESFP-ISTJ':{
    overview:'You navigate the world through immediate sensory feedback (Se) and deep internal values (Fi). You look at the ISTJ and see someone anchored entirely to the past—a person who operates via a strict archive of proven precedents (Si) and cold, mechanical execution (Te).',
    strengths:'They are your bedrock. Because they flawlessly handle the boring, logistical realities of life (taxes, schedules, infrastructure), you are freed up to be the vibrant, spontaneous, and fully present force you naturally are.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute devotion to "how we\'ve always done it" (Si) to be mind-numbingly rigid. When you make an impassioned, values-based plea (Fi), their blunt, factual response (Te) will often feel invalidating or dismissive.',
    dynamic:'The performer and the auditor. It is a highly complementary operational setup if you respect the division of labor, but your operating languages could not be more alien to one another.',
    working:'Do not mess with their routines. If you want them to embrace a change, do not appeal to the "vibe" or your feelings; appeal to their Te by showing how the new way is actually more efficient or practical.',
    friction:'You want to seize a spontaneous moment and alter the plan for a better experience; they want to stick to the itinerary at all costs. When you bend their rules, they will view it as a betrayal of trust, and you will view their rigidity as a prison.'
  },
  'ISTJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You build a life on predictability, duty, and proven methods (Si-Te). You look at the ESFP and see a creature of pure, unfiltered, present-moment impulse (Se-Fi)—someone who makes decisions based on subjective feelings with almost zero regard for the established plan.',
    strengths:'They effortlessly handle the social and emotional layers you find draining. They bring literal color, joy, and vitality into the highly structured, sometimes sterile fortress you have built.',
    shadow:'You will view their inability to stick to a plan, follow a routine, or anticipate downstream consequences (inferior Ni) as a massive, anxiety-inducing liability. To you, their spontaneity looks like dangerous unreliability.',
    dynamic:'The ultimate "opposites attract" setup. You provide the heavy infrastructure and the safety net; they provide the experience, the entertainment, and the human connection.',
    working:'You must accept that they will never value your Si precedents. Give them clear, firm boundaries on the absolute non-negotiables, but give them total freedom within that fence. Do not try to micromanage their moment-to-moment existence.',
    friction:'You measure care through reliability and follow-through; they measure it through authentic presence. When they flake on a commitment because "the vibe changed," your Te will demand accountability, and their Fi will feel completely attacked by your bluntness.'
  },
  'ESFP-ENFP':{
    overview:'You share the exact same internal compass (Fi-Te), making your values and emotional rhythms perfectly aligned. However, while you are fully immersed in the physical reality of the *now* (Se), they are constantly floating away into the abstract realm of *what if* (Ne).',
    strengths:'Instant, deep, non-judgmental connection. You both prioritize authenticity and fun over structure, making this an incredibly warm and vibrant pairing with absolutely zero pressure to conform.',
    shadow:'You will eventually find their constant need to hypothesize, theorize, and brainstorm to be exhausting. You want to actually *do* the thing and experience it; they want to talk about six different alternative ways the thing could exist.',
    dynamic:'Two wild spirits. It is a brilliant, high-energy friendship or romance that is exceptionally validating emotionally, but practically, it is a logistical disaster waiting to happen.',
    working:'Enjoy the shared Fi emotional connection, but recognize that you will have to be the one to ground the relationship in physical reality. Pull them into the tangible moment when their Ne spirals too far into the clouds.',
    friction:'Because you both possess inferior long-term planning functions (your Ni, their Si), neither of you naturally finishes projects or manages the boring details of life. You will eventually build resentment over who is forced to play the responsible adult.'
  },
  'ENFP-ESFP':{
    overview:'You both lead with an explosive, perceiving extroverted function backed by deep personal values (Fi). But where your Ne generates endless abstract possibilities and hidden meanings, their Se is locked entirely onto the literal, physical, immediate reality.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate cure for your overthinking. When your Ne-Fi loop gets too heavy or detached from reality, their raw Se energy physically drags you out of your head and into a joyful, tangible experience.',
    shadow:'You will eventually find their lack of interest in the abstract deeply frustrating. When you want to discuss theoretical frameworks, universe-level concepts, or hidden connections, their eyes will glaze over because it isn\'t "real" to them.',
    dynamic:'A fast-paced, incredibly warm bond. You supply the imaginative spark, the quirky connections, and the wild ideas; they provide the immediate physical momentum and presence to make it a party right now.',
    working:'Do not expect them to engage in hours of theoretical debate. If you want to connect with them deeply, stop talking about the idea and go physically experience it with them in the real world.',
    friction:'You will crave a conceptual depth they simply do not care to provide. Meanwhile, because both of you actively avoid mundane routines (Si) and definitive closure (Ni), the basic logistics and long-term stability of your shared life will constantly fall apart.'

  'INTJ-ENTJ':{
    overview:'You synthesize complex variables to project and execute optimal, long-term future outcomes (Ni-Te). You look at the ENTJ and see a fellow mastermind (Te-Ni)—someone who shares your exact cognitive stack but who externalizes everything, operating at a terrifying, relentless speed that completely bypasses your need for deep reflection.',
    strengths:'An unstoppable, empire-building machine. You provide the deep, internalized strategic framework that ensures the overarching vision is flawless. In return, they provide the explosive external momentum and people-management required to actually execute the vision at scale.',
    shadow:'Because you both rely heavily on extroverted thinking (Te), you will constantly risk an immovable power struggle over who actually controls the operation. Their aggressive pace will frequently make you feel rushed, while your need to internalize strategy will make them feel stalled.',
    dynamic:'The strategic architect and the commanding general. Immense mutual respect, but plagued by an ongoing tension regarding pace and authority. They go faster than you like; you go deeper than they have patience for.',
    working:'You absolutely must divide your territories. You take the internalized strategic layer and the long-range framework. Let them entirely manage the rapid execution, the external structure, and the people. Do not try to share the exact same steering wheel.',
    friction:'They will initiate an aggressive operational pivot and demand your immediate compliance. You will go completely silent to internalize and process the new variables. They will misinterpret your silence as passive-aggressive resistance, while you will view their impatience as destructive and shallow.'

    overview:'You are looking in a mirror at another dominant Te and auxiliary Ni user. You both navigate reality by structuring the world to achieve massive, long-term outcomes, demanding absolute accountability, and enforcing ruthless execution toward your shared vision.',
    strengths:'An extraordinary, terrifyingly capable powerhouse of execution. When perfectly aligned, there is absolutely zero hesitation, no emotional noise, and an unparalleled shared drive to conquer the objective. You hold the vision and the momentum simultaneously.',
    shadow:'Because you are both dominant extroverted thinkers (Te) who inherently need to lead the group, two ENTJs fighting for control of the same situation is a catastrophic failure mode. Once your Te commits to a direction, neither of you possesses the natural instinct to yield.',
    dynamic:'The ultimate clash of conquerors. It is either flawlessly efficient or brutally combative. There is absolutely no middle ground when two people both fiercely want to be the commanding general.',
    working:'You absolutely must divide your domains completely. You cannot share the same objective or manage the same team. Two ENTJs need two completely separate kingdoms. Define your boundaries explicitly, and never micromanage the other\'s territory.',
    friction:'A critical strategic decision must be made. You will both forcefully assert a different operational direction. Because neither of you will ever submit to the other\'s authority, the partnership will erupt into a massive, scorched-earth power struggle that threatens to destroy the entire project.'

'ENTP-INTJ':{
    overview:'You dismantle reality to explore every possible conceptual angle and relentlessly challenge the status quo (Ne-Ti). You look at the INTJ and see a cold, strategic mastermind—someone who completely bypasses your hurricane of options to evaluate reality against a singular, unyielding future vision (Ni-Te).',
    strengths:'You are the ultimate intellectual stress-test. You aggressively challenge their rigid models before they calcify into dogma, providing brilliant alternatives they would never naturally consider. In return, their relentless drive gives your chaotic ideas an actual, structured landing pad in the physical world.',
    shadow:'You will view their obsessive need to prematurely lock down a decision and forcefully close doors to be an incredibly suffocating intellectual cage. To their Te, your constant need to debate and play devil\'s advocate looks like massive, unprofessional obstructionism.',
    dynamic:'The chaotic debater and the strategic architect. It is an explosively productive dynamic if you can survive the structural tension between your drive to question everything and their drive to settle everything.',
    working:'Sequence is absolute. You must challenge their model and brainstorm wildly *early* in the process. Once they drop the hammer and make the final strategic decision, you must back off and accept that the debate is over.',
    friction:'They will make a final, binding commitment to execute a plan. You will casually attempt to reopen the debate just to explore an alternate logical angle. They will absolutely explode at your lack of discipline, and you will view their certainty as irrational and limiting.'

    overview:'You synthesize complex variables to project and execute optimal, long-term future outcomes (Ni-Te). You look at the ENTP and see a chaotic provocateur—someone who generates brilliant possibilities at breakneck speed (Ne), but who treats reality as an endless debate rather than a plan to be executed.',
    strengths:'They are your ultimate intellectual unlock. Their relentless brainstorming (Ne) shatters your tunnel vision, surfacing innovative options you would never have naturally considered. In return, your ironclad structure (Te) keeps their hurricane of ideas from collapsing into useless, perpetual ideation.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute refusal to commit to a plan, and their tendency to argue positions they do not even hold, to be highly inefficient and maddening. Conversely, they will view your unyielding commitment to a single direction as intellectually rigid and suspicious.',
    dynamic:'The mastermind and the chaotic debater. It is a genuinely productive, intellectually stimulating combination, but characterized by a brutal timing conflict between execution and exploration.',
    working:'You must deploy them exclusively at the front end of a project. Their job is to rigorously break your model before you invest resources; your job is to decide what survives. Do not expect them to follow through on the execution phase.',
    friction:'You will be trying to finalize a critical strategy. They will aggressively argue a contradictory position just for the intellectual thrill, making it impossible to tell if they are serious. You will forcefully shut them down to force a commitment, and they will feel entirely intellectually caged.'

    shadow:'You process ideas through deeply subjective, non-negotiable personal values (Fi). They process ideas as detached playthings to be logically disassembled (Ti). Because they view absolutely everything as an open question to be debated, they will inevitably cross a sacred line and trample your core beliefs.',
    dynamic:'The gentle soul and the chaotic provocateur. It is a high-energy, creatively brilliant pairing, but one fraught with massive emotional danger if they do not learn to turn off their debate mode.',
    working:'You must understand that when they challenge your ideas, they are usually trying to engage with you intellectually, not attack your soul. However, you must explicitly define your non-negotiable values, and they absolutely must learn the difference between a theoretical position and your core identity.',
    friction:'They will casually play devil\'s advocate and aggressively debate a deeply held moral value of yours just for the intellectual thrill of the argument. You will experience this as a direct, hostile attack on your very identity and completely withdraw in pain, while they remain utterly confused by your reaction.'

  'ENTP-INFP':{
    overview:'You dismantle reality to explore every possible conceptual angle and relentlessly challenge the status quo (Ne-Ti). You look at the INFP and see a fellow brainstormer—someone who shares your exact love for abstract possibilities (Ne), but whose entire operating system is governed by a deeply guarded, subjective emotional compass (Fi) rather than logic.',
    strengths:'A brilliant, deeply engaging creative partnership. They match your chaotic mental speed and easily follow your abstract leaps. While you are busy tearing concepts down to their logical studs, they inject a massive amount of authentic, human warmth and visionary passion that actually makes the ideas matter.',
    shadow:'You view every concept, rule, and belief as an open thesis to be aggressively stress-tested. Their values-based processing (Fi) will often seem opaque, overly sensitive, or irrational to your Ti. If you are not careful, your natural communication style will feel like a barrage of relentless personal attacks to them.',
    dynamic:'The provocateur and the gentle dreamer. It is a genuinely connective pairing built on shared exploration, but it carries the constant, very real risk of you accidentally burning down things they hold sacred.',
    working:'You must learn to recognize when an idea is actually a deeply held Fi value. A value is not a debatable position; it is their identity. You must actively turn off your devil\'s advocate mode when touching their core beliefs, or you will completely destroy their trust.',
    friction:'You will treat a sensitive topic as an intellectually fun open question, relentlessly dismantling their stance to find the logical truth. They will experience your debate as a cruel, personal attack on their moral character. They will shut down and view you as toxic, and you will feel intellectually caged.'

You look at the INFP and see a fellow introspective soul—someone who shares your profound emotional depth, but who operates entirely on fiercely guarded, individualistic values (Fi) rather than adapting to the needs of the collective.',
    strengths:'A profoundly deep, quiet, and mutually validating connection. You both comfortably operate entirely below the surface of reality. They provide a space of pure, unpretentious authenticity that allows you to drop your exhausting social mask, while you provide the empathetic foresight and structural warmth that protects them from the harshness of the world.',
    shadow:'Your constant instinct to smooth over conflict and shape-shift to protect the emotional comfort of the group (Fe) will frequently strike their Fi as superficial, manipulative, or deeply inauthentic. Conversely, you will often view their absolute refusal to compromise their personal truth for the sake of peace as stubbornly selfish.',
    dynamic:'The wise counselor and the gentle individualist. The emotional resonance is immense and deeply connecting, but the fundamental friction lies in the ultimate loyalty test: does the wellbeing of the group or the absolute truth of the individual take precedence?',
    working:'You must accept that their introverted feeling (Fi) does not compromise to make people comfortable; do not force them to participate in social pleasantries that violate their core values. Let them anchor the authentic meaning of the relationship, while you handle the external relational diplomacy.',
    friction:'You will actively try to manage a tense social situation by smoothing over an ugly truth to protect the group\'s harmony. They will fiercely refuse to play along with the polite illusion, asserting their authentic values regardless of the disruption. You will view them as socially destructive, and they will view your diplomacy as fake.'

    strengths:'A highly complementary, incredibly capable partnership if trust is established. They provide the unflinching strategic direction, objective logic, and hard boundaries that you naturally hesitate to enforce. In return, you flawlessly manage the complex human layer and relational politics that they completely lack the patience to navigate.',
    shadow:'You will frequently find their blunt, direct communication style (Te) to be deeply harsh and relationally damaging. Because your primary operating system is built on human connection (Fe), their willingness to bulldoze over people\'s feelings to achieve a goal will feel toxic and abrasive.',

    shadow:'Because you both rely heavily on extroverted feeling (Fe) to maintain the peace, you will create a fragile "harmony bubble" where nothing real or ugly is ever allowed to penetrate. You will both endlessly absorb discomfort and manage problems into complete invisibility rather than ever confronting a hard truth.',
    dynamic:'The ultimate empathetic sanctuary. It is profoundly warm and deeply connecting, but highly vulnerable to massive shared blind spots because you both actively avoid conflict.',

While you provide the overarching framework, strategic depth, and cold direction, they provide the energetic social cohesion and relational warmth required to keep the people involved actually motivated.',
    shadow:'You will find their constant need to manage the emotional temperature of the room and "smooth things over" to be highly inefficient, performative, and fundamentally dishonest. Conversely, your complete emotional detachment and demand for blunt directness will frequently frustrate their desperate need for relational warmth.',
    dynamic:'The strategic mastermind and the cultural orchestrator. It is a highly functional relationship that covers massive ground, but it requires immense, deliberate effort because you operate on completely opposite spectrums of logic versus emotion.',
    working:'Total separation of domains is the only way this works. You must provide the cold structural framework and strategic direction, and let them entirely own the people layer. Do not compete on each other\'s terrain, and do not try to force them to operate on pure logic.',
    friction:'You will go silent to internally process a complex strategic problem. Because they rely on constant emotional feedback to feel safe (Fe), they will misinterpret your silence as cold hostility or a broken relationship. You will view their emotional demands as irrational noise, while they view your detachment as cruel.'

    strengths:'A profoundly warm, highly emotionally intelligent partnership. You never have to explain your need to nurture. They provide the profound psychological depth and long-range foresight (Ni) that your socially focused mind sometimes misses, while you provide the confident, extroverted energy to bring their hidden insights into the real world.',
    shadow:'Because you both rely heavily on extroverted feeling (Fe) to maintain the peace, you are both absolutely terrified of interpersonal conflict. You will endlessly absorb negative emotions and manage the harmony of the room rather than ever confronting an ugly, disruptive truth.',
    dynamic:'The cultural orchestrator and the wise counselor. It is an incredibly connecting, deeply supportive, and heavily avoidant dynamic. The surface is flawless, but the foundation risks becoming an echo chamber of unspoken sacrifices.',
    working:'You absolutely must establish a safe space for blunt honesty. You have to give each other explicit, repeated permission to be unhappy and disrupt the harmony. Because their Ni sees the problem coming long before it hits, they must be the one to bravely name it out loud, and you must validate their concern.',

    strengths:'They offer a brilliant, completely non-judgmental intellectual depth that constantly forces you to grow. They provide the rigorous logical stress-testing (Ti) that your emotionally driven mind needs. In return, you provide the social grace, emotional grounding, and relational structure they entirely lack.',
    shadow:'You will find their constant need to play devil\'s advocate and debate sensitive topics to be highly disruptive and relationally toxic. Because they view every rule as a thesis to be debated, you will frequently feel like they are intentionally trying to destroy the cultural peace you are trying to maintain.',

    working:'You must accept that their debate mode is not a personal attack; it is how they explore truth. However, you must draw a hard boundary: they get to challenge your ideas privately, but they absolutely cannot unleash their chaotic debate mode in the delicate social situations you are actively managing.',
    friction:'You will be hosting a group event, carefully maintaining the emotional comfort of everyone involved.

While your blunt logic frequently alienates people, they effortlessly manage the complex relational dynamics of the room, ensuring you stay connected to humanity. In return, your rigorous analytical challenge (Ti) sharpens their grand visions.',
    shadow:'You will view their constant need to manage consensus, enforce social norms, and silence "disruptive" ideas as a suffocating intellectual prison. Their tendency to take your objective, theoretical pushback as a personal emotional attack will make you feel like you are permanently walking on eggshells.',

    working:'You must recognize that their social intelligence (Fe) is a highly complex, necessary survival skill, not just "fakeness." You must actively turn off your debate mode in group settings. Challenge their ideas in private, but respect their absolute authority over the external social environment.',

They effortlessly handle the exhausting relational politics, event planning, and external social heavy lifting that drains your introverted battery. In return, you provide the profound, quiet psychological insight that grounds their relentless extroverted energy.',

You look at the ENFP and see someone incredibly warm and inspiring, but who is constantly chasing spontaneous, abstract possibilities (Ne) and acting purely on subjective feelings (Fi) with little regard for structure.',
    strengths:'An incredibly energetic, genuinely connecting partnership. While you are busy managing the complex relational dynamics and future trajectory of the group, their relentless creativity and infectious enthusiasm keep the environment vibrant and prevent you from burning out under the weight of your own responsibilities.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute inability to commit to a plan or follow through on a promise to be deeply frustrating and relationally unreliable. Their chaotic pace and tendency to change their mind based on how they "feel" will frequently disrupt the carefully cultivated harmony (Fe) you work so hard to maintain.',
    dynamic:'The cultural orchestrator and the imaginative whirlwind. You both love people and possibility, but you optimize for unified progress and consensus, while they optimize for individual freedom and authenticity.',
    working:'Do not try to cage them with rigid social schedules or expect them to operate with your level of disciplined follow-through; they will simply rebel and disappear. Let them provide the creative energy, and you provide the structural container.',
    friction:'You will rely on them to fulfill a specific role in a group event you organized. They will change their mind at the last second because they "didn\'t feel inspired." You will explode at their lack of reliability, and they will feel crushed by your demands for conformity.'

    overview:'You navigate the world by generating endless possibilities and filtering them through your deeply personal values (Ne-Fi). You look at the INFP and see a quieter reflection of yourself (Fi-Ne)—someone who shares your exact cognitive functions but who guards their inner moral compass even more fiercely and moves at a much slower, more introspective pace.',
    strengths:'Unparalleled mutual understanding and creative depth. You never have to explain your need for authenticity or your imaginative leaps. You provide the extroverted energy to bring their quiet dreams out into the open, while they provide a deeply safe, non-judgmental space for your most vulnerable feelings.',
    shadow:'Because you both rely heavily on abstract ideas (Ne) and internal feelings (Fi) while actively ignoring the physical, structural world, neither of you naturally finishes anything. You will create a massive, beautiful echo chamber of dreams with absolutely zero real-world execution.',
    dynamic:'The loud dreamer and the quiet dreamer. An incredibly warm, validating, and profoundly connecting relationship, but one that suffers from an almost total lack of practical output or logistical grounding.',
    working:'You absolutely must introduce external accountability into the relationship. If you want to actually build a life or complete a project together, you have to actively force yourselves to engage with mundane reality, set deadlines, or outsource the logistics.',

You look at the ENFP and see a louder, more chaotic reflection of yourself (Ne-Fi)—someone who shares your exact values and creative depth, but who rapidly blasts their ideas outward rather than holding them internally.',
    strengths:'A profound, almost telepathic level of mutual understanding. They effortlessly match your creative depth while providing the extroverted spark and social energy you naturally lack. You provide the deep, quiet emotional anchor that helps ground their chaotic whirlwind of ideas.',
    shadow:'Neither of you possesses the natural instinct to build structure, adhere to a schedule, or finish what you start. Because you both prioritize subjective feelings and endless exploration over hard facts and deadlines, the practical, logistical layer of your shared life will completely fall apart.',

    friction:'A critical, practical life task will need to be completed (taxes, paying bills, fixing a leak). You will both avoid it because it is boring and uninspiring. The practical reality of your lives will collapse around you, causing massive stress and forcing one of you to reluctantly become the "bad guy."'

If an established system is outdated or fundamentally broken, you will both stubbornly defend it indefinitely simply because "that is how we have always done it."',
    dynamic:'The ultimate administrators. It is an incredibly comfortable, profoundly reliable, and completely drama-free partnership, but it is at extreme risk of becoming entirely static.',

    strengths:'Massive, unparalleled creative energy. You operate on the exact same high-speed intellectual wavelength, effortlessly bouncing from one abstract concept to the next. They provide rigorous logical stress-testing for your ideas, while you provide a genuine, authentic warmth that they naturally lack.',
    shadow:'The completion problem is doubled. Because you both are addicted to starting new things and hate finishing them, you will generate thousands of brilliant concepts and execute absolutely zero of them. Furthermore, their need to aggressively debate everything will frequently feel invalidating to your Fi.',

    working:'You must set explicit, externally enforced deadlines, or nothing will ever get done. Furthermore, you must understand that when they debate your ideas, it is not a personal attack on your soul; it is simply how their brain plays with concepts.',
    friction:'They will casually play devil\'s advocate and relentlessly poke holes in one of your deeply held moral values just for the intellectual thrill of the debate. You will take this as a highly personal, hostile attack on your character, while they will be utterly baffled by your emotional reaction to a "theoretical exercise."'

    strengths:'Incredible creative compatibility and intellectual stimulation. They match your chaotic pace effortlessly and never bore you. While you tear concepts down to their logical studs, they inject a massive amount of authentic, human warmth and visionary passion that makes the ideas actually matter.',
    shadow:'Neither of you wants to close the loop. You both exist entirely in the "what if" phase, creating a massive graveyard of unfinished projects. Additionally, their tendency to validate an idea based on how it makes people "feel" will frequently strike your Ti as intellectually soft or irrational.',
    dynamic:'The provocateur and the creative soul. High-speed intellectual exploration mixed with genuine affection, but entirely lacking the structural discipline required to actually build anything in reality.',
    working:'You must establish harsh external accountability to force yourselves to finish what you start. Crucially, you must remember that their deeply held values are not just theories to be poked—do not use their core beliefs as intellectual punching bags, or you will destroy the trust.',
    friction:'You will want to keep debating a sensitive topic to find the absolute, objective logical truth, entirely ignoring the emotional weight of the subject.

You look at the INTP and see a detached, floating brain—someone who endlessly questions the fundamental logic of everything (Ti-Ne) but refuses to commit to a practical, established method.',
    strengths:'They provide the profound, independent analytical depth that your precedent-focused mind often bypasses. Before you execute a flawed procedure just because "that is how it is done," they can systematically dissect the logic and save you from failure. In return, you provide the ironclad logistical grounding they completely lack.',
    shadow:'You will view their endless need to keep decisions open and question the rules as agonizingly slow, uncommitted, and deeply obstructive. To your Te, a proven method is meant to be executed; to their Ti, relying on past precedent without questioning the underlying logic is intellectually lazy.',
    dynamic:'The administrator and the philosopher. It is a relationship of high intellectual friction. You optimize for what is proven to work; they optimize for understanding exactly why it works.',
    working:'You must strictly phase your interactions. Bring them in during the design phase and let them relentlessly analyze the logic. However, once you make the final decision (Te), you must establish a hard boundary that the theoretical debate is over and execution begins.',

Because you rely on the proven past (Si), you cannot blindly follow their intuitive leaps into the future (Ni) without hard data to back it up.',

They handle the granular accountability, the daily maintenance, and the unglamorous execution that you naturally find exhausting.',

    strengths:'They provide the ironclad structure and sheer follow-through that you naturally lack. While your brilliant ideas often die in the theoretical phase, they possess the terrifying operational capability to actually execute tasks, manage logistics, and keep your physical reality from collapsing.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute demand for compliance, measurable output, and adherence to "the manual" to be a suffocating intellectual prison. Their tendency to execute a process simply because "it is how we have always done it" will strike your Ti as infuriatingly intellectually lazy.',

To your Fe, their willingness to bulldoze over people\'s feelings and completely discard perfectly good, safe routines just to achieve a future goal is both toxic and terrifying.',
    dynamic:'The quiet guardian and the architect. It is a pairing of extreme opposites. They operate entirely on future logic; you operate entirely on past experience and present harmony. It requires immense, deliberate translation to function.',
    working:'You absolutely cannot rely on them to intuitively read your emotional state; you must use literal, direct words to state your needs. Stop quietly absorbing their bluntness to keep the peace. You must explicitly name the problems, and they must acknowledge that your relational care is *real work*.',
    friction:'They will deliver a harsh, rapid-fire critique of a system you maintain. You will absorb the blow to avoid a fight, but you will quietly withdraw and display passive resistance. They will read your silence as stubborn incompetence, and you will view them as a cruel tyrant.'

  'INTJ-ISFJ':{
    overview:'You synthesize complex variables to project and execute optimal, long-term future outcomes (Ni-Te).

    strengths:'They flawlessly handle the messy, exhausting human element and physical logistics that you naturally bypass. While you are designing the overarching strategy of the future, they quietly manage the relational politics and literal daily maintenance that keeps your physical life from collapsing.',

When a hard pivot needs to be made, their desire to cling to "the established routine" will look like a dangerous, irrational operational liability to your Ni.',

    working:'You must recognize that your bluntness is experienced by them as literal hostility. You must soften your delivery—not the content, but the delivery. Meanwhile, you must demand that they state their concerns directly using objective facts rather than retreating into silent martyrdom.',

You never have to explain your need for stability or your desire to nurture; they instinctively understand and reciprocate it. You both show up in specific, highly consistent ways, creating a perfectly safe harbor.',

    dynamic:'The ultimate sanctuary. It is incredibly warm, deeply supportive, and heavily avoidant. The surface is completely flawless, but the foundation is a breeding ground for unspoken, accumulating sacrifices.',
    working:'You absolutely must establish a "safe word" for blunt honesty. You have to give each other explicit, repeated permission to be unhappy, complain, and disrupt the harmony. If you do not build a rule for directness, the relationship will stagnate in a polite, superficial warmth.',

Meanwhile, you provide the warm, structured, and entirely reliable physical reality that prevents them from completely isolating themselves in the theoretical void.',

Their tendency to bluntly point out the logical flaws in your cherished traditions will feel like a deliberate, hostile attack on your values.',
    dynamic:'The quiet guardian and the detached analyst. You live entirely in the practical, social present; they live entirely in the theoretical, logical abstract. You cover each other\'s blind spots perfectly, but communication requires constant translation.',
    working:'You must accept that their introverted thinking (Ti) does not speak the language of emotional validation. Stop trying to force them to perform extroverted warmth, and do not interpret their blunt, factual observations as personal insults. One of you must bravely explicitly name the problems.',
    friction:'They will point out a glaring logical inefficiency in how you manage a household or social event. Because you pour your heart into that care (Fe), you will feel deeply invalidated and withdraw into silent hurt. They will be utterly baffled as to why an objective fact made you cry.'

  'INTP-ISFJ':{
    overview:'You deconstruct the universe into precise, internal logical frameworks (Ti-Ne). You look at the ISFJ and see the ultimate traditionalist—someone whose entire existence revolves around upholding arbitrary routines (Si) and performing an exhausting, irrational social harmony (Fe) at the expense of objective truth.',

    strengths:'A profound, deeply empathetic sanctuary. You both automatically prioritize the emotional safety and comfort of everyone around you. They effortlessly handle the deep, psychological insights and long-term relational trajectory, leaving you completely safe to provide the practical, tangible daily care that holds the world together.',
    shadow:'Because you both heavily rely on extroverted feeling (Fe), you are both terrified of disrupting the peace and will sweep massive problems under the rug. Furthermore, their relentless focus on the future and hidden meanings (Ni) will frequently feel ungrounded, anxious, or dismissive of the perfectly good reality (Si) right in front of them.',
    dynamic:'The quiet guardian and the wise counselor. The emotional resonance is beautifully aligned, but your temporal orientations are completely opposite. You find safety in what has already been proven; they find safety in anticipating what is coming next.',
    working:'You must recognize that their intuitive warnings about the future are rarely just baseless anxiety—they see patterns you naturally miss. Let them handle the long-range relational navigation, while you own the practical present. One of you must bravely choose to name the ugly problems out loud.',
    friction:'A major transition is approaching. They will clearly see the impending change and want to completely overhaul the system to prepare for it. You will fiercely resist because the current, established method feels safe. You will view them as unnecessarily disruptive, and they will view you as stubbornly blind.'

  'INFJ-ISFJ':{
    overview:'You synthesize complex patterns to project future outcomes and deeply understand the human condition (Ni-Fe). You look at the ISFJ and see someone who shares your profound warmth and emotional intelligence (Fe), but who is entirely anchored to past precedent, rigid routines, and the literal surface of reality (Si).',
    strengths:'They are your ultimate practical anchor. While you are burning out your nervous system trying to predict the future and heal everyone\'s trauma, they quietly, flawlessly handle the immediate, tangible logistics of care—ensuring you actually eat, sleep, and survive the physical world.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute reliance on "how things have always been done" (Si) to be incredibly creatively stifling. When you try to explore the deeper meaning behind an event, their tendency to focus entirely on the literal, physical details will leave you feeling profoundly alone and intellectually unchallenged.',

    working:'Do not expect them to join you in the deep end of existential philosophy—that is not their domain. Appreciate the massive amount of invisible, practical maintenance they do for you, and realize that keeping things "light and routine" is a valid form of love.',
    friction:'You will foresee a toxic pattern developing in a dynamic and want to intervene. They will actively resist your intervention because the current tradition, even if slightly flawed, is familiar and safe. You will feel frustrated by their lack of vision, and they will feel attacked by your need to change things.'

When their chaotic nature inevitably causes their real-world logistics to completely collapse, you possess the exact practical competence to step in and save them.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute refusal to take anything seriously, conform to social norms, or respect established precedent to be deeply offensive and highly destabilizing. Because they view every single rule as a thesis to be debated, you will constantly feel like they are intentionally trying to destroy your peace.',
    dynamic:'The quiet guardian and the chaotic debater. It is a highly volatile collision between the ultimate preserver of order and the ultimate agent of disruption. You want safe consensus; they want to poke the bear.',
    working:'You cannot manage them with Fe guilt or social pressure; they are completely immune to it. You must draw hard, objective boundaries about where and when their debate mode is unacceptable. Let them brainstorm, but never, ever let them run the logistics.',
    friction:'They will casually play devil\'s advocate and debate the validity of a deeply held tradition that you rely on for emotional safety.

    strengths:'They are the ultimate logistical safety net. While you are lost in a hurricane of abstract ideas and entirely forgetting to maintain your physical reality, they effortlessly provide the warm, structured, and profoundly reliable foundation that keeps you from completely self-destructing.',
    shadow:'You will view their constant need to manage consensus, enforce established routines, and silence "disruptive" ideas as a suffocating intellectual prison. Their tendency to take your objective, theoretical pushback as a personal emotional attack will make you feel like you are permanently walking on eggshells.',
    dynamic:'The provocateur and the concerned caretaker. They provide the warm, structured reality, and you provide the chaotic innovation. However, you fundamentally clash over the value of safety versus the value of exploration.',
    working:'You must actively turn off your debate mode when dealing with their core values. Do not treat their deeply held traditions as intellectual punching bags. Understand that their routines are their safety—if you disrupt them just for the thrill of the debate, you are actively destroying their environment.',
    friction:'You will attempt to introduce a massive, unnecessary change to a system just to see what happens. They will panic, dig their heels in, and fiercely defend the established method. You will feel suffocated by their fear of change, and they will feel fundamentally threatened by your chaos.'

They handle the broad, exhausting social orchestration and future planning, leaving you safe to handle the intimate, practical details of daily life.',

You look at the INFP and see a gentle, imaginative soul—someone who operates entirely on deeply guarded, subjective feelings and abstract possibilities (Fi-Ne) with absolutely no regard for traditional social norms.',

Because they process their feelings internally (Fi), you will often feel shut out, wondering why they won\'t just tell you what is wrong so you can fix it.',

Furthermore, their blunt, task-oriented nature will often feel cold to your Fe, while they will view your need to manage everyone\'s feelings as inefficient.',

    working:'You must divide your operational domains completely and draw a hard, legally binding line of authority. Do not try to micromanage each other. You own the present execution; they own the future trajectory.',
    friction:'You will insist on using the established, reliable method to complete a project. They will unilaterally demand a complete pivot to a new strategy because it serves a larger future goal. A massive power struggle will erupt over whose authority wins.'

    overview:'You structure reality to achieve massive, long-term outcomes (Te-Ni). You look at the ESTJ and see a fellow commander—someone who shares your exact, uncompromising drive for results (Te), but who is stubbornly anchored to past precedent, outdated manuals, and strict present-day compliance (Si).',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate operational machine. They match your relentless pace and possess the structural discipline to actually build the empire you envision. They handle the granular accountability that you find exhausting, ensuring your big ideas actually get executed.',
    shadow:'You will view their rigid adherence to "standard operating procedure" as deeply unimaginative and intellectually stubborn. Because you both require absolute control over your environments (Te), sharing a power structure will constantly feel like a threat to your autonomy.',
    dynamic:'The mastermind and the commanding general. Two incredibly capable executives sharing the same room. It is a wildly productive pairing, provided you do not try to give each other orders.',
    working:'Total separation of domains is required to survive. You must own the strategy and the long-range vision, and you must give them absolute authority over the day-to-day tactical execution. Do not micromanage their process.',

    overview:'You manage reality through strict accountability, rapid decision-making, and objective execution (Te-Si). You look at the INTP and see a detached, floating brain—someone who endlessly analyzes abstract possibilities (Ti-Ne) but completely refuses to commit to a decision or execute a practical task.',
    strengths:'They possess the exact analytical depth that your fast-moving, execution-oriented mind completely bypasses. Before you bulldoze ahead into a flawed plan, they have the ability to systematically dissect the logic and save you from catastrophic systemic failure.',
    shadow:'You will view their endless need to question the rules and explore hypothetical alternatives as agonizingly slow, uncommitted, and deeply insubordinate. To your Te, a decision is meant to be executed, not debated forever.',
    dynamic:'The executive and the philosopher. It is a highly stressful collision between the need for immediate action and the need for infinite analysis. You optimize for getting it done; they optimize for getting it right.',
    working:'You must strictly phase your interactions. Bring them in during the design phase and let them relentlessly stress-test the logic. However, once you make the final decision (Te), you must establish a hard boundary that the debate is over and execution begins.',
    friction:'You will make a final operational decision and demand immediate compliance. They will ignore the command and continue to point out logical inconsistencies in your premise. You will explode at their insubordination, and they will view your demand for blind compliance as intellectually lazy.'

You look at the ESTJ and see a rigid, aggressive bureaucrat—someone who blindly enforces established procedures and demands immediate compliance (Te-Si) without ever stopping to analyze if the rules actually make sense.',

    strengths:'They provide the profound human insight and long-range foresight that you completely lack. While you are hyper-focused on executing the immediate steps, their uncanny ability to read the room and predict downstream consequences acts as a vital early-warning system for your blind spots.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute refusal to commit to a plan without "feeling right about it" to be incredibly frustrating. Because they operate on intuition (Ni) rather than empirical data (Si), you will constantly demand proof that they simply cannot give you yet.',

    working:'You must accept that their "gut feelings" about people and future outcomes are not just irrational anxiety; their Ni is synthesizing real data. Let them own the long-term vision and human layer, while you own the operational execution.',
    friction:'They will warn you that a plan is going to fail because the "pattern feels wrong." You will demand hard metrics to prove it; when they can\'t provide the data, you will dismiss them and execute the plan anyway, crashing straight into the exact disaster they predicted.'

Before you invest massive resources into a flawed plan, their chaotic ability to poke holes and find alternate angles (Ne) will save you from catastrophic failure. Meanwhile, you force them to actually produce tangible output.',

    working:'You must treat their challenges as valuable intelligence rather than insubordination—but only *before* the decision is made. Establish a strict boundary: they get to brainstorm and challenge the plan in the design phase, but once execution begins, the debate is entirely over.',

Their complete lack of abstract imagination (Ne blindspot) will frequently make them seem narrow-minded and stubbornly blind to better ways of doing things.',

    overview:'You synthesize complex patterns to project future outcomes and carefully curate the emotional environment (Ni-Fe). You look at the ESTJ and see a ruthless, unimaginative machine—someone who bulldozes human feelings and ignores long-term consequences just to hit an immediate metric (Te-Si).',

    shadow:'You will find their relentless bluntness (Te) and lack of empathy to be deeply suffocating. Furthermore, because they only trust empirical evidence and past precedent (Si), your intuitive leaps into the future will constantly be met with cold, invalidating skepticism.',
    dynamic:'The mystic and the commanding officer. They build the rigid machine, and you try to give it a soul. You cover each other’s blind spots perfectly, but communication requires constant, exhausting translation.',
    working:'You must accept that they cannot read your subtle emotional cues and do not operate on "vibes." If you want them to alter a plan, you cannot use emotional or intuitive arguments; you must translate your Ni insights into objective, Te-friendly data and metrics.',
    friction:'You will refuse to commit to their operational plan because you intuitively foresee it damaging the group\'s culture down the line. They will demand hard proof of this future failure; when you can\'t provide it, they will steamroll your concerns, leaving you feeling profoundly disrespected.'

    overview:'You manage reality through strict external accountability, proven procedures, and objective metrics (Te-Si). You look at the ENFJ and see someone who is also a natural leader, but whose entire operating system is bogged down by the need to orchestrate emotional harmony (Fe) and chase abstract future visions (Ni) rather than enforcing the rules.',
    strengths:'You are an unstoppable leadership duo if you divide the world correctly. You build the rock-solid operational framework and make the hard, unpopular logistical calls, while they manage the cultural climate, ensuring the people actually stay motivated enough to execute your plans.',

    shadow:'You will find their blunt, directive communication style to be unnecessarily aggressive and relationally damaging. To your Fe, their willingness to bulldoze a group\'s morale just to adhere to a strict rule or timeline is both toxic and short-sighted.',
    dynamic:'The cultural orchestrator and the commanding officer. You are both driven to organize the external world, but you optimize for consensus and growth, while they optimize for execution and compliance.',
    working:'You must understand that their bluntness is not a personal attack; it is simply how their brain transmits efficiency. Let them own the hard operations, and you own the relational layer. Translate their blunt Te directives into Fe language so the team can digest them.',

You look at the ISTJ and see your quieter counterpart (Si-Te)—someone who shares your absolute devotion to hard work and reliable precedent, but who prefers to execute quietly rather than dictate to the room.',
    strengths:'Unmatched operational reliability. You are an unstoppable machine of efficiency. Because you both honor your commitments and value objective logic, you completely eliminate the emotional noise and flakey behavior that you both despise in other people.',

    strengths:'Exceptional, highly predictable execution. You perfectly cover each other\'s operational blind spots. They handle the loud, external enforcement and structural leadership, leaving you free to manage the details, maintain the systems, and actually get the work done in peace.',
    shadow:'Their constant need to externally dictate and control every metric (Te) will often feel like oppressive micromanagement to your independent Si. Because you both aggressively defend "the right way" to do things, power struggles over process are inevitable.',

    dynamic:'The mad scientist and the concerned parent. They provide the warm, structured reality, and you provide the chaotic innovation, but you fundamentally clash over the value of social harmony versus objective truth.',
    working:'You must actively turn off your debate mode in social settings they are managing. Do not treat their deeply held traditions as intellectual punching bags. Understand that their Fe harmony is their reality—if you disrupt it, you are actively destroying their environment.',

    strengths:'An unstoppable wave of genuine warmth and social grace. You never have to explain the concept of emotional labor to them; they instinctively share the burden of reading the room, making people comfortable, and ensuring everyone feels included.',
    shadow:'Because you both share a dominant Fe, you are both terrified of ruining the mood or initiating a harsh confrontation. Furthermore, you will frequently find their lofty future visions (Ni) disconnected from the practical, tangible reality (Si) of what needs to be done today.',
    dynamic:'The community pillar and the visionary guide. It is an incredibly warm, deeply supportive echo chamber where everyone feels loved, but where the hard, ugly truths are systematically swept under the rug.',

Because their logic is entirely internal (Ti), you can never track or audit how they arrived at a solution, which deeply stresses your Te.',

    working:'Do not overwhelm them with endless abstract hypothetical scenarios. If you want to connect with them deeply, stop talking and join them in a shared physical activity. Respect that their silence is not emptiness; it is just a different medium of feeling.',
    friction:'You will want to discuss the deeper psychological meaning behind a conflict; they will just want to physically move on from it. Your tendency to over-explain your feelings will exhaust them, and their refusal to verbally process will leave you feeling abandoned.'

    shadow:'You will view their relentless need to manage the emotional temperature of the room (Fe) as manipulative and inauthentic. Their total detachment from the physical present (inferior Se) will feel incredibly heavy to your spontaneous, freedom-loving spirit.',
    dynamic:'The free-roaming artist and the wise guide. They offer you a map to the future, but you will constantly rebel and slip away if you feel they are trying to force you to actually walk a specific path.',
    working:'Recognize that their Fe is not "fake"—it is genuinely how they care for people. Do not mistake their gentle guidance for a desire to control you. However, you must state your boundaries out loud, because they will assume your silence means agreement.',

    shadow:'You will find their strict devotion to "how we have always done it" (Si) incredibly creatively stifling. To your Fi, their tendency to prioritize the rules, the schedule, and the obligation over human emotion feels deeply robotic and invalidating.',
    dynamic:'A quiet, low-drama partnership of parallel play. You share introversion and a lack of social noise, but you operate for completely different reasons: you optimize for authenticity, and they optimize for reliability.',

You look at the ESTJ and see a rigid, unrelenting machine—someone who demands absolute compliance to external structures, hierarchies, and metrics (Te-Si) while completely ignoring the human soul.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate shield against the logistical nightmare of the real world. Because they so flawlessly execute the boring, structural, and administrative tasks you despise, they provide a highly secure foundation for you to safely exist and create.',
    shadow:'You will find their obsession with rules, deadlines, and efficiency to be profoundly oppressive. Their blunt, directive communication style (Te) will frequently feel like a violent, personal attack on your identity and autonomy.',
    dynamic:'The free spirit and the drill sergeant. It is a highly demanding partnership that requires an immense amount of deliberate translation. You bring the color; they bring the framework.',

    overview:'You optimize for the immediate tactical win (Se-Ti). You look at the ENTJ and see a relentless dictator—someone who wants to control the entire board and subjugate the present moment to achieve some distant, inflexible 10-year vision (Te-Ni).',
    strengths:'They build the massive operational empires that you love to play in. They handle the boring strategic logistics and long-term planning, giving you a high-powered, well-funded environment to execute your real-time tactical maneuvers.',
    shadow:'You will find their need to control every variable and adhere to long-term plans suffocating. To your dominant Se, their refusal to pivot and seize an immediate, unexpected opportunity looks like stubborn, arrogant blindness.',
    dynamic:'The frontline operator and the commanding general. Immense mutual respect for pure capability, but constant power struggles over who is actually steering the ship in the moment.',
    working:'Do not surprise them with massive deviations from the plan unless you have immediate, undeniable results to justify it. Speak their language (Te) by showing how your tactical pivot actually accelerates their overarching strategy.',
    friction:'You will break protocol to seize a sudden advantage. They will view this as gross insubordination that jeopardizes the long-term mission. You will call them rigid and slow; they will call you a rogue, unpredictable liability.'

  'ENTJ-ESTP':{
    overview:'You structure reality to achieve massive, long-term outcomes (Te-Ni). You look at the ESTP and see a highly lethal, completely unmanageable mercenary—someone who acts entirely on immediate tactical leverage (Se-Ti) with zero regard for the overarching strategy.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate rapid-response weapon. When the master plan fails and you need someone to parachute into the chaos and fix a crisis in real-time, no one is faster, braver, or more effective.',
    shadow:'You will view their inability to delay gratification or stick to a multi-step plan as a massive liability. Their tendency to optimize only for the next 10 minutes makes them fundamentally untrustworthy to your forward-looking Ni.',
    dynamic:'The general and the wildcard. You deeply value their raw execution speed, but you are perpetually stressed by their refusal to respect your authority or follow your step-by-step procedures.',
    working:'You cannot micromanage an ESTP. Give them the absolute boundaries and the final objective, then look away. Evaluate them entirely on whether the target was hit, not on whether they followed your preferred process.',
    friction:'You will demand strict adherence to a strategic timeline. They will ignore it to chase an immediate, high-reward distraction. You will attempt to lock them down with strict rules, and they will immediately rebel or walk away.'

'ESTP-INFP':{
    overview:'You seize the immediate physical environment (Se) and hack it using fast, tactical logic (Ti). You look at the INFP and see someone completely paralyzed by abstract daydreams (Ne) and hypersensitive, subjective personal morals (Fi) that make zero logical sense to you.',
    strengths:'They provide a completely non-judgmental, quiet space away from the noise of the world. Their quirky, imaginative ideas (Ne) can actually be incredibly fun when you take the initiative to physically execute them in real life.',
    shadow:'Their total lack of physical urgency (Se blindspot) and their refusal to look at situations objectively will drive you crazy. You will often view their endless emotional processing and physical inaction as cowardly or fundamentally broken.',
    dynamic:'The loud operator and the quiet dreamer. You share zero cognitive functions. You physically drag them into reality to experience life, and they offer a gentle retreat when you finally burn out.',
    working:'When they retreat, do not force them into a loud confrontation. Realize that your standard Ti bluntness feels like a literal physical blow to their Fi. You cannot logic them out of an emotion; just give them time.',
    friction:'You will drop a harsh, tactical truth to solve a problem. They will absorb it as a crushing personal attack, shut down completely, and vanish. You will view their silence as pathetic evasion, and they will view you as a toxic bully.'

    shadow:'You will view their transactional logic (Ti) and complete lack of foresight (inferior Ni) as shallow, callous, and reckless. Their tendency to casually bulldoze people\'s feelings for a quick win will deeply offend your core values.',
    dynamic:'The gentle soul and the frontline soldier. They act as your physical vanguard in a scary world, but cognitively, you operate in completely different dimensions with absolutely no shared language.',
    working:'Stop expecting them to read your mind or validate your complex emotional state. If you are hurt or need something, you must use plain, literal words to tell them—they cannot read your subtle Fi cues and will not guess.',
    friction:'Their extreme directness hits your core values like a sledgehammer. You will retreat into silence to protect your peace, and they will demand you "get over it" and face reality, leaving you feeling profoundly unsafe and unseen.'

  'ESTP-INFJ':{
    overview:'You dominate the literal, physical present (Se) using fast, tactical logic (Ti). You look at the INFJ and see a mystic floating entirely outside of reality—someone obsessed with predicting invisible futures (Ni) and managing everyone\'s feelings (Fe) instead of just acting.',
    strengths:'They possess the exact long-range radar you lack. Because they can accurately predict the downstream consequences of a situation before it happens, they serve as an incredibly valuable early-warning system for your blind spots.',
    shadow:'You will find their physical passivity (inferior Se) and their endless agonizing over future implications to be paralyzing. Their need to constantly manage group harmony (Fe) will seem like fake, inefficient nonsense to your objective Ti.',
    dynamic:'The frontline operative and the oracle. You share the exact same cognitive axes, but in reverse. You push the gas; they are the brakes. It works beautifully if you actually listen to each other.',
    working:'Do not dismiss their "hunches" as mere anxiety—their Ni is almost always tracking real data you missed in your rush to act. However, do not let their need to plan everything drag you into permanent inaction.',
    friction:'You want to seize an immediate tactical opening; they want to wait because the "long-term pattern feels wrong." You will act anyway, and when the situation inevitably blows up, their silent "I told you so" will infuriate you.'

    shadow:'You will view their inability to foresee downstream disasters (inferior Ni) as terrifyingly reckless. Their tendency to casually break social harmony for a quick, logical win will strike your Fe as brutish and deeply inconsiderate.',
    dynamic:'The seer and the adrenaline junkie. They represent everything that excites and terrifies you. You provide the meaning, the map, and the safety net; they provide the sheer momentum of being alive.',
    working:'You must accept that you cannot control them. Do not use Fe guilt to rein them in, and do not expect them to share your profound foresight. Let them own the physical moment, and use your Ni to steer around the messes.',
    friction:'You will clearly see the disastrous long-term consequence of their reckless choice and warn them. They will ignore you, act in the moment, and crash. You will silently burn with resentment as you are forced to clean up the wreckage.'

'ESTP-ENFP':{
    overview:'You live for the tangible present, leveraging reality exactly as it is (Se-Ti). You look at the ENFP and see a whirlwind of chaotic abstractions—someone bouncing endlessly between hypothetical universes (Ne) guided entirely by subjective feelings (Fi) rather than mechanical truth.',
    strengths:'They are never boring. They generate an endless supply of novel, wild ideas, and since you possess the physical bravery and tactical ability to execute them immediately, you two can turn a mundane afternoon into an unforgettable adventure.',
    shadow:'You will find their inability to stay focused on physical reality exhausting. When you want to execute a plan, they want to discuss five alternative ways it *could* happen. Furthermore, their Fi emotional reasoning will seem completely illogical to your Ti.',
    dynamic:'The operator and the brainstormer. Maximum extroverted energy, but zero shared cognitive functions. You act as the physical anchor to their floating, abstract balloon.',
    working:'Let them brainstorm, but take firm control of the actual execution. When they start spiraling into "what ifs," bring them back to what is physically in front of you. Do not try to logic-check their deeply held personal values.',
    friction:'You want to seize the literal moment; they want to explore the infinite potential of the moment. They will view your transactional approach as shallow, and you will view their abstract theorizing as a total waste of time.'

    overview:'You navigate the world through endless possibilities and deep, authentic meaning (Ne-Fi). You look at the ESTP and see someone who is entirely bound to the literal surface of reality, operating purely on cold, mechanical leverage (Se-Ti) with zero interest in the abstract.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate cure for your analysis paralysis. When your ideas are stuck in your head, they possess the sheer physical momentum and fearlessness to drag you into the real world and make the experience actually happen.',
    shadow:'You will quickly realize they have absolutely no interest in your deep, philosophical rabbit holes. To them, if it isn\'t tangible or immediately useful, it doesn\'t matter. Their blunt Ti can also feel incredibly dismissive of your sensitive Fi values.',
    dynamic:'A high-voltage, fast-paced collision. They provide the adrenaline and the action; you provide the imagination and the novelty. But you will eventually hit a hard ceiling on emotional and conceptual depth.',
    working:'Do not expect them to read between the lines or indulge in theoretical philosophy. If you want to connect with them, you have to meet them in the physical world. Appreciate their literalness for what it is—what you see is exactly what you get.',
    friction:'You will crave a soulful, conceptual connection that they simply cannot—and will not—provide. When you try to find the hidden meaning in an event, they will bluntly tell you "it is what it is," leaving you feeling profoundly unseen and invalidated.'

    shadow:'You will find their need to control the emotional temperature of the room exhausting and fake. To your Ti, their tendency to prioritize "how everyone feels" over the objective, mechanical truth of a situation is a massive, irrational inefficiency.',
    dynamic:'The tactical rogue and the cult leader. They set the grand stage and manage the audience, while you execute the high-wire act. You share Se and Ni, but your priorities are completely inverted.',
    working:'Let them manage the social politics and the long-term vision. Do not intentionally blow up their carefully curated group harmony just to prove a point. Use your tertiary Fe to actively show them you appreciate their effort.',
    friction:'You will deliver a blunt, necessary truth that shatters the room\'s harmony. They will view you as an aggressive, selfish disruptor; you will view them as a manipulative, passive-aggressive control freak trying to cage your autonomy.'

    shadow:'You will view their total disregard for group harmony and long-term consequences as a massive liability. Because they completely lack your Ni foresight, you will constantly feel like you have to play damage control for the relational messes they leave behind.',
    dynamic:'The visionary host and the hired gun. You respect their capability but distrust their methods. They bring brilliant excitement to your structured world, but they require constant supervision to ensure they don\'t break the culture.',
    working:'Do not try to guilt-trip them using Fe—they will not care, and they will see right through it. Frame your requests using cold, objective logic (Ti). Give them a clear, immediate problem to solve, and stay out of their way while they fix it.',
    friction:'They will casually insult someone or break a social norm because it was the most efficient route to a goal. Your Fe will be horrified by the collateral damage, and when you attempt to discipline them, they will laugh and walk away.'

    overview:'You navigate the world by exploiting real-time opportunities and solving immediate tactical problems (Se-Ti). You look at the ISFJ and see someone whose entire existence is devoted to maintaining the past, avoiding risk, and keeping everyone comfortable (Si-Fe).',
    strengths:'They provide the absolute stability and logistical continuity you neglect. While you are out fighting fires or chasing the next high-leverage moment, they are quietly ensuring your home base, your health, and your relationships do not collapse.',
    shadow:'You will find their paralyzing fear of the unknown (inferior Ne) and their strict adherence to routine (Si) incredibly tedious. To your blunt Ti, their tendency to beat around the bush or suppress the truth just to maintain "harmony" feels weak and passive-aggressive.',
    dynamic:'The front-line operator and the safe harbor. You push the boundaries and take the risks; they maintain the infrastructure. It is highly complementary as long as you do not expect them to join you in the chaos.',
    working:'You must soften your delivery. To them, your standard Ti directness sounds like a violent attack. Do not spring massive, spontaneous changes on them without warning—their Si needs time to adjust to new information.',
    friction:'You will make a fast, unilateral decision that disrupts their carefully managed routine. When you explain the cold logic of why you did it, their Fe will reject it because you ignored how it made people feel. They will withdraw, and you will feel weighed down by their unspoken guilt.'

    strengths:'They are fearless. When your anxiety about the future (Ne) paralyzes you, or when you are trapped in a social conflict you are too polite to handle, they will step in and decisively solve the problem with zero hesitation.',
    shadow:'You will view their constant need for thrill-seeking and their disregard for safety or precedent as deeply irresponsible. Their transactional, objective logic (Ti) will often strike you as callous, harsh, and totally devoid of empathy.',
    dynamic:'The caretaker and the mercenary. They bring excitement and physical protection, while you offer a warm, predictable refuge. But you will constantly stress over the messes they leave in their wake.',
    working:'Accept that they live in the present moment (Se) and cannot be confined to your rigid routines. Do not try to passive-aggressively manage them with guilt—they will not pick up on your subtle Fe cues. If you need something, state it plainly as a fact.',

    strengths:'They do the grueling, boring, detail-oriented work that you despise. Because they perfectly maintain the systems, the budget, and the schedule, you are completely free to improvise on the front lines without the back-office falling apart.',
    shadow:'You will find their utter lack of physical spontaneity and real-time adaptability to be a massive tactical flaw. When you see a brilliant shortcut, their refusal to take it simply because "it violates protocol" will drive you insane.',
    dynamic:'The improviser and the auditor. It is an incredibly powerful operational machine, provided you operate in completely separate spheres. You handle the dynamic environments; they handle the static ones.',
    working:'Do not force them to wing it. Let them build the spreadsheet, set the baseline, and audit the results. When you inevitably break their rules to get a result, frame your explanation entirely around efficiency and facts (Te), not just because it "felt right."',
    friction:'You will bypass a bottleneck by ignoring a rule. They will be furious that the procedure was disrespected; you will be furious that they care more about the procedure than the fact that you successfully solved the problem.'

    shadow:'You will view their refusal to plan ahead, their disdain for documentation, and their willingness to cut corners as deeply unprofessional. To you, their entire lifestyle looks like an unsustainable gamble waiting to crash.',
    dynamic:'The general and the special operative. You hold the line and maintain the standard; they operate outside the wire. Mutual respect for getting things done keeps you aligned, despite hating each other\'s methods.',
    working:'You cannot micromanage them with standard operating procedures. Give them the goal and the absolute hard boundaries, but let them figure out the mechanics in real-time. Judge them purely on their outcomes, not their methods.',
    friction:'They will abandon your carefully scheduled itinerary to jump on a sudden, high-risk opportunity. Your Te will demand they be held accountable for breaking the structure; their Ti will mock you for being too slow to seize the moment.'

'ESTP-ESFJ':{
    overview:'You read the room to leverage the moment and act decisively (Se-Ti). You look at the ESFJ and see someone who curates the room to maintain permanent harmony and tradition (Fe-Si).

    strengths:'They effortlessly handle all the relational maintenance and social obligations that you find tedious. They create a loyal, stable, and welcoming network that you can operate within and benefit from.',
    shadow:'You will find their obsession with "appropriate" behavior, routine, and group consensus (Fe-Si) stifling. You will view their tendency to avoid hard, logical truths just to spare someone\'s feelings as weak, inefficient, or inauthentic.',
    dynamic:'The operator and the host. You provide the bold action, the excitement, and the problem-solving; they provide the warm, stable community and the social safety net.',

    friction:'You will deliver a blunt, necessary truth (Ti) to solve a problem; they will experience it as a violent attack on the group\'s culture (Fe). They will try to control your behavior to fit their social norms, and you will bolt.'

    overview:'You manage the emotional climate and maintain stable traditions for the people you care about (Fe-Si). You look at the ESTP and see a charming rogue—someone incredibly present and socially aware, but who acts entirely on immediate, calculating logic (Se-Ti) with zero regard for the rules.',

  'ESTP-ESTJ':{
    overview:'You adapt to the present moment, doing whatever it takes to win right now (Se-Ti). You look at the ESTJ and see a rigid bureaucrat—someone who insists on organizing the world through strict rules, hierarchies, and past precedents (Te-Si), even when a faster way is obvious.',
    strengths:'They build the infrastructure that you refuse to build. They ensure the bills are paid, the resources are managed, and the long-term goals are met, allowing you to operate freely in the tactical present without your life collapsing.',
    shadow:'You will find their blind devotion to standard operating procedures infuriating. When a faster, better way is staring them right in the face (Se), they will refuse to take it simply because it isn\'t "the approved process" (Si).',
    dynamic:'The tactical strike and the logistics general. This is highly effective if you divide the world strictly into "right now" and "the long game," but it requires checking your egos at the door.',
    working:'Do not argue with them about the rules; just deliver the results. They respect sheer competence (Te). Let them handle the systematic execution, and have them deploy you exclusively for the rapid, unscripted problems.',

    dynamic:'The executive and the mercenary. You respect their raw ability to get things done, but you are constantly stressed by their rogue methods and lack of respect for authority.',

    strengths:'Highly capable in the physical world. You can act together without needing to over-explain the tangible reality. They have a quiet, aesthetic edge and a physical bravery that you genuinely respect.',

    strengths:'They pull you out of your head and into the present moment. They share your authentic, non-judgmental nature but possess the bold social energy and outward momentum you often lack.',
    shadow:'Their constant need for external action (Se) can feel superficial to your deep Fi. You may doubt whether they actually feel things deeply simply because they move on to the next experience so quickly.',
    dynamic:'A vibrant, shared sensory world. They act as the vanguard, taking the social hits and opening doors, while you provide the quiet, unwavering authenticity and depth behind them.',
    working:'Let them handle the heavy lifting in high-energy social spaces. Understand that their rapid context-switching isn\'t a lack of depth or care—it is simply their primary survival tool for navigating the world.',
    friction:'You process conflict by retreating and reflecting; they process it by getting louder and seeking immediate external resolution. Their insistence on keeping the moment "alive" will trample your need for quiet integration.'
  },
'ESFP-ISTP':{
    overview:'You both thrive in the immediate, physical world (shared Se), but your internal engines are entirely alien to each other. You engage the present to extract meaning and emotional intensity (Fi), while they engage it to deconstruct and solve it mechanically (Ti).',
    strengths:'Unparalleled present-moment synergy. You do not have to explain the physical or situational reality to them—they read the environment as clearly as you do. Together, you can navigate fast-paced, high-stakes situations effortlessly without over-planning.',
    shadow:'You will find their primary operating mode (Ti) cold, detached, and unsettling. Because they do not naturally radiate emotional warmth or validate your deeply held values, you may incorrectly read their mechanical silence as disdain, apathy, or even cruelty.',
    dynamic:'You are the heart and the heat; they are the hands and the ice. It is a highly functional tactical partnership, provided you do not look to them for deep emotional resonance or mirroring.',
    working:'Let them handle the technical breakdown of the situation while you manage the social and emotional climate. Accept that they express care by fixing physical problems for you, not by validating your feelings.',
    friction:'You need authentic emotional warmth (Fi), and they offer precise, often blunt, logical corrections (Ti). When you are hurting, their instinct is to troubleshoot you like a broken machine, which will leave you feeling profoundly unseen and invalidated.'
  },
  'ISTP-ESFP':{
    overview:'You recognize and respect their ability to react instantly to the present moment (Se), but you are fundamentally baffled by what drives them. Where you slice through reality with objective, detached logic (Ti), they navigate it through a chaotic, highly subjective web of personal feelings (Fi).',
    strengths:'They bring a vibrancy and social fluency that pulls you out of your isolated mechanical world. You can act together in real-time without the drag of theoretical nonsense or endless forward-planning.',
    shadow:'You will view their Fi-driven decision-making as utterly irrational, overly dramatic, and exhausting. You may dismiss their emotional intensity as mere noise or attention-seeking, missing the actual unshakeable depth of their internal convictions.',
    dynamic:'A clean, highly effective division of labor. They take the social spotlight and manage the human energy of the room, allowing you to operate quietly in the background, diagnosing and fixing the actual problems.',
    working:'Understand that their feelings are their facts. You cannot logic (Ti) them out of a firmly held Fi emotional state. Do not try to troubleshoot their emotions; just fix the physical problem while giving them space to process.',
    friction:'When a crisis hits, you want to strip away the emotion to find the mechanical truth. They want to amplify the emotion to find the authentic truth. Your blunt diagnosis will strike them as cruel, and their emotional processing will strike you as a massive waste of time.'
  },
  'ESFP-ESFJ':{
    overview:'To the outside world, you look like similar, highly social extroverts. But under the hood, your operating systems clash. You seek raw, spontaneous, authentic experience (Se-Fi), while they are building structured, predictable, socially harmonious environments (Fe-Si).',
    strengths:'An incredibly warm and socially dominant pairing. You bring the spontaneous spark and the vibrant energy to the room, while they provide the infrastructure, the planning, and the continuity that keeps your shared life stable.',
    shadow:'You will often find their relentless focus on group harmony (Fe) to be deeply inauthentic, fake, or performative. Their reliance on routine, precedent, and "how things are done" (Si) will feel like a suffocating cage to your need for total freedom.',
    dynamic:'You are the entertainer and the free spirit; they are the host and the caretaker. The dynamic thrives when you are allowed to be the wild card, provided you do not completely blow up their carefully laid plans.',
    working:'Respect the invisible labor they do to keep your shared life functioning. When they ask for a commitment, give them a clear answer—their Si needs predictability to feel safe, even if you hate being tied down.',
    friction:'They want you to conform to social expectations and show up reliably; you want the freedom to follow your energy. Their attempts to manage your schedule will feel like parental control, and your resistance will feel, to them, like profound selfishness.'
  },
  'ESFJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You are both warm, people-oriented, and highly visible. However, you channel your energy into maintaining the social fabric and fulfilling obligations to the group (Fe-Si), while they are surfing the immediate, unpredictable wave of their own personal desires (Se-Fi).',
    strengths:'They inject pure, unfiltered joy and spontaneity into your world, breaking you out of your rigid routines. Together, you create an incredibly welcoming, highly energized, and aesthetically beautiful social atmosphere.',
    shadow:'You will view their Fi-driven independence as deeply selfish. Because they prioritize their authentic feeling in the moment over their obligations to the group, you will constantly see them as unreliable, flaky, or emotionally immature.',
    dynamic:'A frequent parent/child dynamic emerges. You will naturally take over the logistics, the planning, and the relational maintenance, while they happily consume the experiences and harmony you facilitate.',
    working:'You must stop expecting them to value your Si-traditions or your Fe-social contracts. Let them own the immediate moment and the energy, but firmly draw boundaries around what you are willing to manage for them.',
    friction:'You will silently build resentment as you carry the weight of the actual relationship maintenance, while they seem completely oblivious. When you finally demand accountability, they will accuse you of being controlling, rigid, and a killjoy.'
  },
'ESFP-ESTJ':{
    overview:'You operate purely in the present moment, guided by what feels authentic and alive (Se-Fi). You look at the ESTJ and see a walking spreadsheet—someone who attempts to organize, structure, and control the entire physical world through sheer willpower and rigid precedent (Te-Si).',
    strengths:'They actually build the infrastructure that allows you to have fun. Because they flawlessly handle the boring, logistical realities of life (schedules, finances, structures), you are freed up to fully experience the moment.',
    shadow:'You will find their obsession with rules, efficiency, and "how things are done" (Si) to be suffocating and deeply unimaginative. Their blunt, directive communication (Te) will frequently strike your Fi as aggressive, bossy, and entirely lacking in emotional nuance.',
    dynamic:'The classic collision of the free spirit and the executive. It works beautifully when you stay in entirely separate lanes—you handle the charm and the energy, and they handle the execution and the budget.',
    working:'Do not fight them on the logistics; let them own the plan. However, firmly draw your own boundaries around your autonomy. They respect strength and directness (Te), so tell them plainly what you will and will not do, rather than just evading them.',
    friction:'They demand punctuality, compliance, and predictable output. You demand freedom, spontaneity, and authenticity. When they try to micromanage your time, you will rebel instantly. Their Te will try to crush your Fi, and your Fi will completely ignore their Te.'
  },
  'ESTJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You view the world as a system to be optimized, structured, and reliably executed (Te-Si). You look at the ESFP and see a tornado of erratic, feeling-driven impulses—someone who acts entirely on what is happening right now (Se) with zero regard for standard operating procedure.',
    strengths:'They possess the exact kind of warm, immediate, charismatic social energy that you naturally lack. They can sell a vision, read a room, and melt the ice in situations where your blunt Te would only cause resistance.',
    shadow:'You will view their complete lack of long-term planning (inferior Ni) and their reliance on subjective feelings (Fi) as a massive liability. To you, they are unpredictable, undisciplined, and fundamentally incapable of adhering to a reliable structure.',
    dynamic:'A high-capability manager wrangling a star talent. You provide the anchor and the operational spine; they provide the face, the energy, and the human connection. It requires massive patience from your side.',
    working:'Do not expect them to follow your step-by-step procedures. Give them a clear boundary and a desired outcome, but let them navigate the present moment their own way. If you try to script their behavior, they will shut down.',
    friction:'When they abandon the plan because it no longer "feels right" (Fi), you will view it as gross insubordination. When you enforce accountability, they will accuse you of being a toxic, controlling dictator. The fight is always about predictability versus freedom.'
  },
  'ESFP-ISFJ':{
    overview:'You both value warmth and physical experiences, but your compasses point in opposite directions. You are chasing the novel, the thrilling, and the authentically "now" (Se-Fi). You look at the ISFJ and see someone anchored entirely to the past, the familiar, and the safe (Si-Fe).',
    strengths:'They provide an incredibly warm, stable, and deeply loyal home base. When your chaotic, high-energy adventures leave you burnt out, the ISFJ is the person who reliably puts you back together with specific, practical care.',
    shadow:'You will find their terror of the unknown and their strict adherence to routine (Si) incredibly boring. Furthermore, their tendency to suppress their own desires just to keep the peace (Fe) will strike your authentic Fi as fake, passive-aggressive, or frustratingly opaque.',
    dynamic:'The adventurer and the anchor. You bring the excitement and pull them out of their shell; they provide the consistency and the safety net that prevents you from flying entirely off the rails.',
    working:'Do not drag them into highly unpredictable, chaotic environments without warning. Appreciate the quiet, invisible ways they maintain your shared life, and gently encourage them to state what they actually want, rather than what they think you want.',
    friction:'You want to change the plan on a whim; their Si panics at sudden changes. When they are overwhelmed by your pace, they will not yell—they will quietly withdraw and build silent resentment, leaving you feeling trapped by unspoken guilt.'
  },
  'ISFJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You spend your energy curating a safe, predictable, and harmonious environment for the people you care about (Si-Fe). You look at the ESFP and see someone who blows through that careful curation, living loudly and unpredictably in the immediate moment (Se-Fi).',
    strengths:'They breathe fresh air into your life, pulling you out of your comfort zone and showing you how to genuinely enjoy the present without worrying about the past or the future. Their warmth is highly contagious.',
    shadow:'You will view their recklessness and their constant need for new stimulation as exhausting. Because they prioritize their personal feelings (Fi) over the harmony of the group (Fe), you may frequently see them as oblivious, inconsiderate, or selfish.',
    dynamic:'The caretaker and the wild child. It is a deeply affectionate bond, but you will inevitably take on the role of doing the invisible maintenance work (bills, schedules, cleaning up the emotional messes) while they consume the experiences.',
    working:'Accept their inconsistency. Let them be the entertainment and the energy, but do not rely on them to maintain the structural or traditional foundations of your life. Enjoy their light, but anchor yourself.',
    friction:'You will sacrifice your own needs to support them, assuming they will notice and reciprocate (Fe). They won\'t, because they expect you to simply state what you want (Fi). Your silent resentment will eventually boil over, leaving them completely blindsided.'
  },
'ESFP-ENFJ':{
    overview:'You live purely in the authentic present (Se-Fi), acting on what feels real right now. You look at the ENFJ and see someone constantly orchestrating the future and managing the emotional temperature of the room (Fe-Ni)—a process that feels suspicious to you.',
    strengths:'They naturally handle the heavy lifting of organizing the social world. They create beautiful, frictionless environments that give you the perfect stage to shine and express your vibrant energy.',
    shadow:'To your dominant Fi, their relentless Fe harmony-management looks like fake, performative people-pleasing. You just want to *be* with people; they want to *manage* people, and you will fundamentally distrust their curated warmth.',
    dynamic:'The spontaneous spark and the grand orchestrator. It works brilliantly when you let them host and they let you perform, but you will always resent it if you feel they are trying to "handle" you.',
    working:'Call out their unspoken expectations gently but firmly. If you just want to hang out without it becoming a highly orchestrated social event or a deep growth exercise, you have to tell them plainly.',
    friction:'They will try to guide you toward what they (Ni-Fe) believe is your "best self." You will see this as a patronizing, controlling attempt to rob you of your autonomy, and you will rebel by deliberately breaking their social harmony.'
  },
  'ENFJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You spend your energy orchestrating group harmony and cultivating long-term human potential (Fe-Ni). You look at the ESFP and see a dazzling but chaotic force of nature—someone who acts entirely on immediate, subjective feeling (Se-Fi) with zero regard for the collective plan.',
    strengths:'They bring the raw, unscripted vitality that your carefully curated environments sometimes lack. They are fully alive in the moment, which gives your tertiary Se a massive, much-needed boost of pure joy.',
    shadow:'You will view their Fi-driven independence as fundamentally selfish. While you are bending over backward to ensure everyone in the room is comfortable, they will abruptly change the vibe or flake on a plan simply because they "don\'t feel like it anymore."',
    dynamic:'You are the director, and they are the star. You will constantly try to corral their vibrant energy into something meaningful or structured, while they will constantly slip the leash to follow their impulses.',
    working:'Stop trying to actualize their potential or turn them into a project. Let them exist in the moment. Accept that their loyalty is to their own internal authenticity (Fi), not to your social contracts (Fe).',
    friction:'You build a beautiful, fragile social architecture, and they knock it over on a whim. Your resentment will build because they rarely recognize or appreciate the massive, invisible emotional labor you do to keep the group functioning.'
  },
  'ESFP-INFP':{
    overview:'You share the exact same internal compass (Fi), but your vehicle is physical reality (Se) while theirs is abstract possibility (Ne). You express your deeply held values through loud, immediate action; they express theirs through quiet, internal contemplation.',
    strengths:'You do not have to explain your heart to them. They understand your subjective emotional world intuitively, providing an incredibly safe, non-judgmental space for your most authentic self.',
    shadow:'You will find their physical passivity and endless daydreaming (Ne) exhausting. When you want to actually *go do* the thing you both care about, they want to retreat, sit in silence, and process it for another week.',
    dynamic:'The actor and the poet. You physically drag them into the real world to experience life, while they provide you with profound emotional validation and meaning when the party ends.',
    working:'Do not force them to process reality at your blistering speed. Understand that their need to withdraw isn\'t a rejection of the experience or of you—it is the only way their Ne-Si can integrate what just happened.',
    friction:'When they are overwhelmed, their default is to retreat into complete silence. Your Se demands immediate, physical resolution, so their disappearance will feel like an agonizing, passive-aggressive punishment to you.'
  },
  'INFP-ESFP':{
    overview:'You look at the ESFP and see your own dominant function (Fi) strapped to a rocket ship of immediate physical action (Se). They feel things just as deeply as you do, but they process those feelings outwardly, loudly, and instantly.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate antidote to your Ne-Fi overthinking. When you are paralyzed by possibilities, they grab you by the hand and physically pull you into the joy of the present moment, making your shared values tangible.',
    shadow:'You will often question the actual depth of their convictions. Because they jump from physical experience to physical experience so rapidly, your Si and Ne will view their lifestyle as chaotic, exhausting, and occasionally superficial.',
    dynamic:'The anchor and the fireworks. They provide the physical momentum and bravery you often lack, while you offer the quiet, unshakeable depth they secretly crave when they finally slow down.',
    working:'Do not mistake their rapid context-switching for a lack of depth. Accept that they integrate their feelings by physically *experiencing* the world, not by sitting still and dissecting it the way you do.',
    friction:'Their constant need for external stimulation will rapidly drain your social battery to zero. When you inevitably withdraw to recharge, they will take it as a personal Fi rejection, leading to a loud collision over your need for silence.'
  },
'ESFP-INFJ':{
    overview:'You navigate the world through immediate sensory feedback and deep personal authenticity (Se-Fi). You look at the INFJ and see someone who is rarely ever in the room with you—a mystic who processes everything through abstract future predictions (Ni) and the emotional temperature of the group (Fe).',
    strengths:'They offer a profound, quiet sanctuary for your fiery soul. When the party stops and you are left alone with your feelings, the INFJ understands your emotional depth completely, providing a level of meaning and insight that anchors you.',
    shadow:'You will find their total detachment from the physical present (their inferior Se) to be incredibly heavy and depressing. Their constant need to orchestrate group harmony (Fe) will look to your authentic Fi like unnecessary, fake people-pleasing.',
    dynamic:'The physical force and the psychic. You drag them out of their head and into their body to actually experience life; they help you look past the immediate moment to see the overarching narrative of your life.',
    working:'Do not force them into chaotic, high-stimulation environments for long periods without an exit strategy. Understand that their "hunches" are not just guesses—Ni is their reality. Respect their foresight, even if you cannot see the pattern yet.',
    friction:'You want to jump into an experience right now; they want to sit back and analyze the five-year implications of jumping. You will feel judged by their serious, intense foresight, and they will feel steamrolled by your immediate demands.'
  },
  'INFJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You live in the abstract, pulling future patterns into singular truths and managing collective emotional climates (Ni-Fe). You look at the ESFP and see your own absolute weakest function (inferior Se) strapped to a rocket. They are a blur of pure, unfiltered, physical impulse and subjective feeling.',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate antidote to your overthinking. By physically dragging you into the raw, uncurated present moment, they feed your inferior Se the vibrant life experience you secretly crave but can rarely initiate yourself.',
    shadow:'You will watch them make decisions based entirely on immediate physical desires or subjective feelings, utterly blind to the obvious downstream disasters you (Ni) can see coming a mile away. You will find their lack of foresight genuinely alarming.',
    dynamic:'The sage and the rockstar. You provide the deep, strategic compass and the emotional safety net; they provide the adrenaline, the aesthetic beauty, and the sheer vitality of being alive.',
    working:'You must stop trying to script their future or save them from themselves. Let them experience the world. Do not use your Fe to guilt them into conforming to a long-term plan they never agreed to.',
    friction:'You will clearly see the disastrous consequence of an impulsive choice they are about to make, and you will warn them. They will ignore you to chase the experience, and they will crash. It will take all your willpower not to say, "I told you so," while you clean up the mess.'
  },
  'ESFP-ENTP':{
    overview:'You experience reality exactly as it is, anchoring your actions in deeply held, subjective personal values (Se-Fi). You look at the ENTP and see a chaotic, argumentative troll who treats physical reality as a joke and treats your sacred values as theoretical toys to be dismantled (Ne-Ti).',
    strengths:'They are one of the few types who can actually keep up with your high-speed energy. Their Ne spontaneity matches your Se spontaneity, meaning you can bounce from adventure to adventure with zero need for rigid planning.',
    shadow:'Because they process the world through detached logic and endless hypothetical debate, you will find them arrogant, unnecessarily combative, and completely lacking in emotional groundedness. To you, they are all talk and no real substance.',
    dynamic:'A fast, loud, and highly unpredictable collision. You both love novelty, but they want to debate the novelty while you want to physically experience it. You share zero cognitive functions, meaning misunderstandings are constant.',
    working:'You must understand that when they debate you, they are not personally attacking your identity—debate is just how they play. However, you must explicitly draw a hard boundary around your core Fi values and tell them those are off-limits.',
    friction:'They will casually play devil\'s advocate against a core moral value you hold deeply (Fi). You will feel profoundly attacked and disgusted by their lack of empathy; they will be genuinely confused as to why you are being so "sensitive" over a purely hypothetical argument.'
  },
  'ENTP-ESFP':{
    overview:'You navigate the world by generating endless abstract possibilities and ruthlessly stress-testing them with logic (Ne-Ti). You look at the ESFP and see someone entirely bound to literal, physical reality, whose entire decision-making process is based on "how I feel about it" (Se-Fi).',
    strengths:'They pull you out of the theoretical clouds and into the physical world. Their warmth, aesthetic brilliance, and raw social energy provide a literal playground for your chaotic ideas to manifest in real-time.',
    shadow:'You will find their reliance on subjective "emotional truth" (Fi) to be logically bankrupt and intellectually exhausting. When you try to discuss universe-level concepts, you will get bored when they inevitably drag the conversation back to literal, immediate experiences.',
    dynamic:'High-energy party friends. You supply the witty, absurd ideas, and they provide the physical momentum to make it happen. But cognitively, you are speaking across a massive void with zero shared functions.',
    working:'You have to stop treating their deeply held personal values as debate prompts. They do not view their Fi as an interesting thesis to be deconstructed—they view it as their soul. If you pick it apart, you will permanently damage the relationship.',
    friction:'You want to argue about *why* something is the way it is; they want to just *experience* it. When you poke holes in their emotional reasoning, they will shut down and view you as a toxic, heartless robot, leaving you feeling like you have to walk on eggshells.'
  },
'ESFP-ENTJ':{
    overview:'You live in the vivid present, guided by authentic feeling (Se-Fi). You look at the ENTJ and see your exact cognitive stack flipped upside down—a relentless executive who subjugates the present moment to build empires for the future (Te-Ni).',
    strengths:'They provide the ironclad structure and forward momentum (Te) that you struggle to build. They actually execute on the grand visions, creating a secure, organized environment where your vibrant energy can thrive without you having to manage the logistics.',
    shadow:'You will find their obsession with efficiency and future outcomes deeply dehumanizing. To your dominant Fi, their willingness to bulldoze over people\'s feelings and immediate experiences to achieve a goal looks like the behavior of a ruthless dictator.',
    dynamic:'The free spirit and the commander. It works incredibly well when you let them drive the long-term strategy and they let you manage the human, present-moment morale, but it requires massive mutual respect.',
    working:'Do not appeal to their emotions when you disagree; appeal to their logic (Te). Show them how a happy, emotionally engaged team or partner is actually a more *effective* one, and they will listen.',
    friction:'They will try to organize, optimize, and schedule your life, which you will experience as a direct attack on your autonomy. You will rebel against their control, and they will view your rebellion as pure, self-destructive incompetence.'
  },
  'ENTJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You view reality as a chessboard, constantly organizing the external world to achieve a singular future vision (Te-Ni). You look at the ESFP and see a chaotic blur of immediate physical impulse and subjective emotion (Se-Fi)—your exact cognitive stack, inverted.',
    strengths:'They effortlessly wield your tertiary Se, bringing a raw, vibrant physical energy and social charm that you desperately need but cannot naturally generate. They melt the ice in rooms you would otherwise freeze with your bluntness.',
    shadow:'You will view their complete inability to plan for the future (inferior Ni) as a fatal flaw. Their tendency to make major life choices based entirely on "how they feel" (Fi) will strike you as wildly irresponsible and inefficient.',
    dynamic:'The CEO and the muse. You build the stage, and they perform on it. It is an extremely high-leverage partnership if you can tolerate the total lack of structure on their end and they can tolerate your intensity.',
    working:'You must stop trying to optimize them. Give them clear domains where they have total freedom to act in the moment. Accept that their emotional depth (Fi) is a feature, not a bug, and you cannot bully it into submission.',
    friction:'When you enforce a necessary, long-term strategic constraint, they will throw a deeply emotional, rebellious fit. You will view them as an undisciplined child ruining the plan; they will view you as a soulless tyrant ruining their life.'
  },
  'ESFP-ESFP':{
    overview:'You are looking in a mirror at another dominant Se and auxiliary Fi user. You both prioritize authentic, immediate experiences above all else, resulting in a partnership that is 100% present and 0% planned.',
    strengths:'Unmatched mutual understanding of the need to live fully right now. You validate each other\'s deepest values without judgment and create a shared reality that is loud, beautiful, and profoundly warm.',
    shadow:'Because you both possess inferior Ni, neither of you naturally models the downstream consequences of your actions. The boring, structural layer of life (Te) is entirely neglected in favor of the next great experience.',
    dynamic:'A brilliant, fast-paced party that eventually runs out of funding. The emotional highs are incredibly high, but the practical foundation is usually crumbling beneath your feet.',
    working:'You absolutely must invite external structure into this dynamic. Hire an accountant, use rigid calendar apps, or explicitly designate one person to handle the logistics on a rotating basis before the chaos consumes you both.',
    friction:'When the bills are due or a crisis hits, both of you will look to the other to play the responsible adult. Since neither of you actually wants the job, you will resent each other for the shared practical collapse of your lives.'

'ESFP-INTP':{
    overview:'You live in the vivid, physical present (Se-Fi). You look at the INTP and see a ghost—someone who exists entirely inside their own head, deconstructing abstract theories (Ti-Ne) while completely ignoring the vibrant reality happening right in front of them.',
    strengths:'They possess an intellectual depth that is entirely removed from social drama. When you actually get them talking, their detached, quirky Ne observations can be genuinely hilarious and offer a completely novel way of looking at the world.',
    shadow:'You will find their absolute detachment from the physical world (Se blindspot) and their lack of emotional expressiveness (inferior Fe) to be freezing cold. You want to engage with life; they want to analyze it from a safe distance.',
    dynamic:'The physical spark and the floating brain. You share zero cognitive functions, meaning you operate in completely different dimensions. You pull them into the real world, but the tether is thin.',
    working:'Do not expect them to match your physical energy or validate your Fi emotions. When you want to connect, invite them into a low-pressure, shared physical activity where they do not feel forced to perform emotionally.',
    friction:'You will need warmth, presence, and immediate feedback. They will offer silence, hesitation, or a highly technical analysis of why you are feeling what you are feeling. You will feel rejected, and they will feel overwhelmed.'

  'ESFP-INTJ':{
    overview:'You exist to physically engage with the immediate moment (Se). You look at the INTJ and see your exact cognitive opposite—a mastermind who lives entirely in a projected 10-year future (Ni) and attempts to ruthlessly structure reality to get there (Te).',
    strengths:'They are the ultimate anchor. Because they have mapped out every future contingency and built the infrastructure (Te) to handle it, you are completely free to live in the present without worrying about the sky falling.',
    shadow:'You will find their inability to just "be" in the moment tragic and frustrating. Their blunt, directive communication (Te) will often strike your authentic Fi as tyrannical, bossy, and devoid of basic human warmth or spontaneity.',
    dynamic:'The performer and the architect. It is an extreme polarity. They build the arena, and you bring it to life, but only if you both accept that you are speaking fundamentally different languages.',
    working:'Do not mistake their seriousness for anger. When they give you a directive, it is not to control you; it is to optimize the environment. Speak to their Te: show them how your spontaneous approach actually solves a practical problem.',
    friction:'They will view your spontaneous choices as reckless sabotage of their grand plan. You will view their rigid timelines and intense foresight as a suffocating cage designed to drain all the joy out of your life.'

  'INTJ-ESFP':{
    overview:'You project into the future, synthesizing patterns into a singular vision (Ni) and executing it (Te). You look at the ESFP and see a blur of raw, uncurated physical impulse (Se)—your exact inferior function, running the show with zero long-range strategy.',
    strengths:'They represent everything you struggle to access. They pull you out of your relentless mental simulations and force you to actually experience the physical world, bringing a warmth and vitality that your Te-heavy life desperately needs.',
    shadow:'You will view their inability to delay gratification or anticipate downstream consequences as a profound liability. Their reliance on subjective feelings (Fi) over objective logic will seem wildly inefficient and chaotic to you.',
    dynamic:'The mastermind and the wild card. It requires immense mutual tolerance. You provide the strategic spine and the safety net, while they provide the human connection and the sensory joy.',
    working:'You cannot optimize an ESFP. Do not treat them like a chaotic variable in your system that needs to be managed. Give them the freedom to own the present moment, and use your Ni to simply steer around the inevitable messes.',

    overview:'You deconstruct reality into precise logical frameworks (Ti-Ne). You look at the ESFP and see a creature of pure, unfiltered physical energy and subjective emotion (Se-Fi)—someone who seems to exist entirely on the surface of reality without ever questioning the mechanics beneath it.',
    strengths:'They provide the exact social and physical momentum you lack. While you are stuck in an endless analytical loop, their raw Se energy cuts through the theory and drags you into the real world, reminding you that you actually have a body.',
    shadow:'You will find their relentless focus on the immediate, literal present to be intellectually barren. Because they prioritize authentic feelings (Fi) over objective truth (Ti), you will struggle to find a shared wavelength for deep conversation.',
    dynamic:'The theorist and the thrill-seeker. You share zero cognitive functions. It is a relationship of alien fascination that works best in small, highly active doses rather than deep, isolated one-on-one time.',
    working:'Do not try to engage them in hours of abstract debate. To connect with them, you have to leave your head and join them in a shared physical experience. Let them handle the social environment entirely.',
